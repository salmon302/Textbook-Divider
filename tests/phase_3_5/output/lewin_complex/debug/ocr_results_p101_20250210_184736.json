This device will help clarify for musicians the numerical ratios in-\nvolved among those numbers. The number 180, which labels the fastest beat\non figure 4.2a, is represented on figure 4.2b by the highest pitch, high C.\nSlower tempi, in their numerical ratios to MM180, are represented on figure\n4.2b by lower pitches in the corresponding frequency ratios to high C. For\ninstance, on figure 4.2a the opening tempo of the cello is MM120, 2/3 of the\ntempo MM180 coming up in the viola. On figure 4.2b the tempo MM120 is\n",
