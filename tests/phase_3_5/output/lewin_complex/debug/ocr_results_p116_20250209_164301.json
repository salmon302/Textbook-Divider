The elements of S, =\nS, X S, are pairs (s, a), where s = (s(1), ... , s(8)) is a pertinent spectrum\nand a is a time point. The pair (s, a) models a class of sounds having pertinent\nspectral profile s at time a. A finite set of such pairs, say the set DVSP =\n((S, a), (Sp) a), \u00ab++ \u00bb (Sys @y)), Models a class of sounds that have spectrum s,\nat time a,, spectrum s, at time a, ... , and spectrum s,, at time a,. We consider\nDVSP to be an unordered set of S,-elements, since the chronological order of\nthe time points a, imposes a natural ordering on the member pairs of DVSP,\nno matter in what order we list those pairs. For convenience, we shall assume\nthe members of DVSP to be listed above in chronological order, that is with\na, < a, < +++ < ay. Supposing the time points a, to be reasonably close, then\nDVSP will model a class of sounds with a certain \u201cdeveloping spectrum.\u201d\nEach sound of this class has pertinent spectrum s, at time a,.\n\npartial #\n\n8 s,(8) s,(8) s,(8) s,(8) s,(8)\n\n2 s,(2) s,(2) $,(2) s,(2) s,(2)\n\n1 s,(1) s,(1) s,(1) s,(1) s,(1)\na, a, a, ay as\n\ntime points\n\nFIGURE 4.5\n\nFigure 4.5 displays DVSP, with N = 5 in this case, as an array of num-\nbers, If we imagine the plane of the page as a base, and erect at each entry\ns(n) a spike of heights s(n) jutting up from that page, we shall obtain a sort\nof sketch for a relief map that shows how the spectrum of the sound develops\nover time. Supposing the time points a, through a, to be dense enough so as\nto catch enough salient features of the sound-class involved (e.g. times when\nsome partial has a pronounced local maximum or local minimum value), then\nwe can consider this sketch to be a good approximation for a continuous re-\nlief map that characterizes the class of sounds with respect to its developing\nspectral \u201csignature.\u201d This sort of relief-map representation is in common use\ntoday as a means for studying various classes of harmonic sounds, including\n\n83\n",
