(The background of the screen is either\nwhite or black.) After the program has computed the interval vector for Y,, it\nwill update the count of various intervals so as to obtain the interval vector for\nY,, changing the color of some dots on the screen as pertinent. Then it will\nupdate the count of various intervals to obtain the interval vector for Y,, and\nso on. The updating can be done quickly following the method of figure 3.3.\n(Remember that you may have to adjoin more than one releasing time-span\nat any new stage. Also remember to adjust for any new dyads that may be\nrelease-ordered but not attack-ordered.) The rhythmic updating of the screen\ncan follow either the serial rhythm of the stages or their \u2018\u2018perceptual rhythm\u201d\nas discussed above, either in real time or suitably scaled for visual effect.\n\n5.4.3.

Since neither the\ntime unit nor the point zero is specified, Y is not strictly a numerical \u201c\u2018set\u201d\nwithin TMSPS, but I am assuming the reader will not mind a certain looseness\nin discourse at this point.) Figure 5.14 also displays \u201csets\u201d X,, X., X, and\n\n5, all of which can be found embedded within Y. X\u2018, is a canonical form of X,\nand X% is a canonical form of X3.\n\nFigure 5.15 shows how the embedding numbers of the set-classes /X,/\nand /X,/ within Y develop, as Y develops over the four stages. The values rise\nat Stage 4 because the dotted half releases there and the appearances of X{, and\nxX, augmented (canonical) forms of X, and X,, can now be counted as fully\n\u201cembedded\u201d in Y. Figure 5.15 shows us how the set-class /X,/ comes on late\nand strong, pulling ahead of /X,/ at Stage 3 and then decisively ahead at\nStage 4.\n\n119\n",
