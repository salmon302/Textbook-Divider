In earlier work I have suggested that our\nbecoming aware of such predominances is associated with our marking such a\ntime-point as an \u201cictus.\u201d * The present analysis supports that theoretical idea,\nsince time-point 5 is both a notated barline, indeed the first notated barline,\nand also audible to some extent as marking the attack of an intuitively\n\u201cstrong\u201d quarter.\n\nThese considerations lie behind my bracketing the first four entries of\ncolumn I on figure 3.3, as belonging together in a special way. According to\nthe theory just sketched, it is only when the 4-element S,-set has been com-\npletely exposed, i.e. it is at and only at a moment just after time-point 5, as we\nlisten along, that we first become sensitive to any regular mensural structuring\nin the passage. Just after time-point 5 we become aware that temporal interval\n| is predominating over other temporal intervals; we can then (and only then)\nhear temporal interval 1 as a beat with which to measure other temporal\nintervals. In that sense the GIS,-structure of figures 3.1\u20143.3 really \u201cbegins\u201d\nfor a listener at (and on/y at) time-point 5, the first written barline and the first\nperceived ictus; any GIS3-structure preceding time-point 5, according to this\ntheory, is reconstructed by a listener at (or following) time-point 5. Not only is\nthe beat established at time-point 5, the pitch-class interval 11 is also es-\ntablished at the same time, as a predominating pitch-class interval. Pitch-class\ninterval t1 is thus bound psychologically to the establishment of mensural\nstructure in the piece, as part of one and the same Gestaltist experience that a\nlistener will be having just after time-point 5.\n\npe interval 11 11 (NB 5 beats later)\n\nrecurs @ time-point 5: 1\ntemporal interval 1 \\/ \\/ Now!\nrecurs @ time-point 5:\n\n1 1\nFIGURE 3.4\n\nFigure 3.4 symbolically collates the ideas discussed just above. The figure\nalso suggests how the temporal interval of \u2018\u2018S beats later\u2019 has already acquired\na special significance at the moment the listener hears time-point 5. \u2018\u2018S beats\nlater,\u201d namely, spans the temporal distance from the opening attack to the\nfirst ictus. Figure 3.4 shows how that temporal distance is already clearly\nassociated with the structural function of the recurrent pitch-class interval 11,\n\n4, David Lewin, \u201cSome Investigations into Foreground Rhythmic and Metric Pattern-\ning,\u201d Music Theory, Special Topics, ed.
