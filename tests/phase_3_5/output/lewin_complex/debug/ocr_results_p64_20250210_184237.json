C,\nCt, D, ..., Bb, B are thereby labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., 10, 11 (mod 12), This\nconvention can be generalized. That is, in any GIS we can always use the\nintervals of the group IVLS to label the members of the space S by their\nrespective intervals from an assumed referential object in S. We can make the\nnotion formal by introducing some new terminology.\n\n3.1.1 Derrition: Given a GIS (S, [VLS, int) and a fixed referential member\n\u201cref\u201d of S, the function LABEL, mapping S into IVLS, is defined by the\nequation\n\nLABEL(s) = int(ref, s).\n\n3.1.2 THEOREM: Whatever the element ref, the function LABEL maps S\n1-to-1 onto IVLS, and it satisfies the formula\n\nint(s, t) = LABEL(s)~* LABEL(t).\n\nProof: Given the element ref and any interval i, there is one and only ones\nin S satisfying int(ref, s) = i, by Condition (B) of Definition 2.3.1 for a GIS.\nSince int(ref,s) is LABEL(s), we have observed the following: Given any i,\nthere is some s satisfying LABEL(s) = i; furthermore, there is only one such s.\nThus the function LABEL is onto; furthermore it is 1-to-1.\n\nNow we prove the formula of the theorem. By definition 3.1.1,\nLABEL(s)\"' LABEL(t) = int(ref,s)~int(ref, t). In that equation we can\nsubstitute int(ref,s)\"! = int(s, ref), via 2.3.2. The equation then states:\nLABEL(s) *LABEL(t) = int(s, ref)int(ref, t). And the expression on the\n\n31\n",
