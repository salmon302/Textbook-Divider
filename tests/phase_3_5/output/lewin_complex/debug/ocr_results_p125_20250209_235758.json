First, the C# and the F# within Y both receive agogic\naccents, marked \u2018\u2018a.a.\u201d on figure 5.2(c). One may query just what this means,\nin the piano register of figure 5.2(a) at the given tempo. It surely means\nsomething, if only something conceptual; the pianist should be thinking like a\nsinging instrument here. Second, the crescendo that begins at the Bp within X,\na crescendo reproduced on figure 5.2(c), is analogous in some degree to the\ncrescendo that begins at the C# within Y, even though the latter crescendo\ndoes not get all the way to the final note of its phrase. Third, the beamed B, C#,\nand F\u00a5# of Y, within figure 5.2(c), occur as every-third-note of ordered Y; there\nis a serial regularity about their occurrence. Fourth, once the E, C#, and Eb of\nY-within-the-music have been brought down an octave to provide the note-\nheads for Y-within-figure 5.2(c), it is easy to hear the latter structure as a com-\npound gesture, counterpointing the rising beamed B\u2014C#-F# (= T, (ordered\nX)) against the falling chromatic counter-gesture-(F\u2014-E)\u2014(Ep\u2014D)-. That\n\u201cfalling chromatic line\u201d on figure 5.2(c) fills in the chromatic space between\nC# and Ft, the medial and final beamed notes of the rising gesture.\n",
