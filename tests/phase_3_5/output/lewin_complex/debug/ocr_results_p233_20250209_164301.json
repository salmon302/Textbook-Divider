We can fix the\nnode/arrow system that underlies all the graphs and networks: NODES is a\ntwo-element family; every pair of NODES is in the ARROW relation.\n\nGraph (a) has as its SGP the group of operations on pitch classes that\ncontains the identity E and the operation I = I4. (This is a group, since II =\nE.) Graph (a) has as its TRANSIT function the function TRANSIT(N,, N,) =\nTRANSIT(N,, N,) = E; TRANSIT(N,, N,) = TRANSIT(N,, N,) =I.\nGraph (b) has the same SGP and the same TRANSIT function as graph (a).\nSo in this special case, graph (b) is in fact literally \u201cthe same as\u201d\u2019 graph (a).\n\nGraph (c) however is \u201cdifferent\u201d (though isomorphic). Its semigroup\ncomprises two operations on twelve-tone rows, not two operations on pitch\nclasses. The row-operations are E (which leaves any row alone) and I (which\ninverts any row about the pitch class A). The TRANSIT function for graph (c)\nmaps ARROW into this new semigroup of row-operations. The semigroup of\nrow-operations, while \u201cnew,\u201d is isomorphic with the old semigroup of pitch-\nclass operations, under the correspondence of pitch-class-operation E with\nrow-operation E and pitch-class-operation I with row-operation I. We can\ntake this map of the old semigroup into the new one as our formal SGMAP.\nAnd we can take as NODEMAP the identity map of our fixed NODES onto\nitself. The (NODEMAP, SGMAP) is a formal isomorphism of graph (a) (or\ngraph (b)) with graph (c). Therefore (NODEMAP, SGMAP) is a formal\nisography of network (a) (or network (b)) with network (c).\n",
