In fact, the rhythmic identity extends back\neven farther: A-Dh-E-Ab\u2014B-ictus and B\u2014ictus-B\u2014Ep\u2014F#\u2014Bp demarcate\nthe same series 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2. Only after the Bp of measure 130 does the\nrhythmic parallelism break off: After that Bp the first duration of 4 appears,\nlaunching us into the transformational complexities of figure 10.2.\n\n(Bb for B)\n\nFIGURE 10.5\n\n10.2 ExaAmpte: Figure 10.5 sketches some structural aspects of Bartok\u2019s\n\u201cSyncopation,\u201d no. 133 from Mikrokosmos, vol. 5. Our ability to hear pro-\nlongation in this sort of context is the subject of an important study by Roy\nTravis.\u2018 Travis tries to hear (GBD) + (Eb F#) asa tonic chord for the piece. It\nworks better to hear (G) + (A#C#D#F#) in that capacity. This is the final\nsonority of the piece and the only complete harmony attacked by both hands\nsimultaneously, an event which occurs at the final barline. That is, itis the only\nharmony which does not involve a \u201cSyncopation.\u201d The syncopations of the\nmusic bring out a broad variety of structural contrasts between the two hands.\nThe left hand plays white notes; the right hand plays black notes. The left hand\nplays \u201cdown\u201d both metrically and sotto; the right hand plays \u2018\u201c\u2018up\u201d both\nmetrically and sopra (with its black notes). The white notes in the left hand\narrange themselves into triadic formations within a G Mixolydian mode; the\nblack notes in the right hand arrange themselves within a pentatonic F\u00a5 mode.\nThe left hand\u2019s chord of reference is a G-major 3, a chord with G on the\nbottom; the right hand\u2019s chord of reference is an F# added-sixth harmony in}\ninversion, a chord with F# on the top.\n\nOver measures 1\u201410 of figure 10.5, one sees how these elements contend\nduring the opening section of the piece. The black notes win out. The opening\n(D#F%#) of the figure is spelled (Ep F#) by the composer, to emphasize its local\ndependency on the left-hand G tonic, But as the section progresses, (EpF#)\nbecomes (Ep Gp) and shows that it can move down an octave to displace the\n\nlt. \u201cToward a New Concept of Tonality?\u201d Journal of Music Theory, vol. 3, no. 2 (November\n1959), 257-84.\n\n225\n",
