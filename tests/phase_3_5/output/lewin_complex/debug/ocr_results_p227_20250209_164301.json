The nodes M, and M, of figure 9.1\ncommunicate. But neither M, nor M, communicates with My.\n\nThe communication relation among nodes is easily proved to be reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive. Hence \u201ccommunication\u201d is an equivalence relation\non the NODES of a node/arrow system. As figure 9.1 suggests, the nodes\nwithin any equivalence class all communicate, each with any other, while\nnodes in different equivalence classes do not communicate.\n\n9.1.3. Deriition: A node/arrow system is connected if any two nodes\ncommunicate.\n\nThe system displayed in figure 9.1 is not connected. It can be analyzed\ninto two component subsystems, each of which is connected; there is no\ncommunication between any node of one subsystem and any node of the\nother. This sort of structure is typical of disconnected node/arrow systems.\nAny disconnected system can be analyzed into component connected sub-\nsystems that do not communicate with one another. Each such subsystem\nis a pair (NODES,, ARROW,), where NODES, is an equivalence-class of\nNODES under the communication relation, and ARROW, is that subcollec-\ntion of ARROW comprising pairs of nodes from NODE,,.\n\nAs we proceed, we shall find the following construct necessary and useful.\n9.1.4 Derinition: An arrow chain from node N to node N' in a node/arrow\n\nsystem is a finite series of nodes Ny, N,,..., N, satisfying criteria (A), (B), and\n(C) below.\n",
