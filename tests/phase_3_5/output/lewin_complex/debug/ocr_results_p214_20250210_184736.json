The RICH\ntransform of RICH(s), being a retrograde-inverted form of a retrograde-\ninverted form of s, must always be some transposed form of s. In the Zauber\nexample above, the interval of transposition is 10: G-Bh\u2014Db\u2014D is the 10-\ntranspose of A-C~Eb-E.\n\nFor another example, let us examine s = Ey-B-Bh\u2014D-C#-C-\u2014F#-\u2014E-\nG-F-A-G#. This is the prime row of Webern\u2019s Piano Variations op. 27.\nRICH(s) is A-G#\u2014-C-Bp-\u2014C#-B-F-E-Ep-\u2014G-F#-D, and RICH(RICH(s))\nis then F{-D-\u2014Dp\u2014F- etc. As before, the RICH transform of RICH(s) is a\ntransposed form of s, but now the specific interval of transposition is different.\nF#\u2014-D-Dp\u2014F- etc. is the 3-transpose, not the 10-transpose, of Webern\u2019s row.\n\nIn general, when we RICH the RICH-transform of an abstract pitch or\npitch-class series s = $,, 8 ,..., Sx, the transposed form of s that results will\nbe T;(s), where the interval of transposition is i = int(s,, $y) + int(Sz, Sx_;).\n(We are supposing that N > 2. The formula is given without proof.) Thus\nthe interval of transposition for the Zauber series A-C-Ep\u2014E was 10 = 7 +\n3 = int(A, E) + int(C, Eb), while the interval of transposition for Webern\u2019s\nrow Ep\u2014B- --- -A-G# was 3 = 5 + 10 = int(Eb, G#) + int(B, A).\n\nIt follows: When we define the operation TCH as (RICH)(RICH), then\nTCH(s) is always some transposed form of s, but just which transposed form\ndepends on the internal structure of any given argument s upon which TCH is\noperating. Specifically, ifi = int(s,, sy) + int(S.,Sy-,), then TCH(s) = T,(s).\nWe shall call i here \u201cthe 7CH-interval for s.\u201d\u201d The TCH interval for a retro-\ngrade or an inverted form of s will be the negative (group inverse) of this i; the\nTCH interval for a retrograde-inverted form of s will be the same as the TCH\ninterval for s itself. (These facts follow from the formula defining i above.)\n\n8.2.2 EXAMPLE: Let us turn our attention once more to figure 7.4, the earlier\nexample from Parsifal, inspecting the first, second, third, and fourth forms of\nZauber that are beamed thereon and labeled as Z,, Z,, Z;, and Z,. Consider-\ning Z as a serial motive, we can graph Wagner\u2019s transformational technique\nhere by figure 8.3.\n\nTCH interval = 10\n\nFIGURE 8.3\n",
