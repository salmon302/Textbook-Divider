These features enable us to extract the intervallic network of figure\n8.7 (a).\n\nFIGURE 8.7\n\nFigure 8.7(b) displays the FATE network for purposes of comparison. A\n3-arrow and a 2-arrow are common to both networks. Another way of\nrelating the motivic fragments is to regard LOVE as an essential A-to-B\nelaborated by an F\u00a2 pickup 3 below A, while regarding FATE as an essential\nA-to-B elaborated by a G\u00a5 pickup 3 below B. This view attributes emphatic\npriority to pitch relations and even pitch hierarchies, at the expense of inter-\nvallic relationships per se. We shall see that the intervallic structures of the\n\u201cTodesverkiindigung,\u201d like those of the Brahms Horn Trio studied earlier,\ntake on a more autonomous role as the music develops.\n\nWe can hear another strong relation of LOVE and FATE in the music\nthrough the harmonization of LOVE that immediately precedes FATE: A-to-\nB within LOVE is supported by C-to-B in the bass; the total matrix thereby\nprojects a pitch-class form of FATE. Figure 8.6 indicates the pitch-class\nintervals of the FATE network on the LOVE matrix accordingly. A 2-arrow\nconnects A to B within the melody of LOVE; that 2-arrow is subarticulated\ninto a \u201c3\u201d-arrow, from A to the C below, and a (\u2014 1)-arrow, from C in the bass\nto B in the bass. The bass B supports and doubles the B of the LOVE melody\nas a pitch class.\n\nSupposing a fundamental bass for the A minor harmony of LOVE, an A\nthat goes under and hence conceptually \u201cbefore\u201d the C of the basso continuo,\nwe can even identify a serial form of FATE embedded in this LOVE music,\nnamely A\u2014C-B. This is the unique form of the FATE series, other than the\nprime form, that embeds the essential A-to-B gesture.\n\nStarting from that A-C\u2014B, we can hear a RICH chain of FATE forms\nproceeding along the bass line of figure 8.6.
