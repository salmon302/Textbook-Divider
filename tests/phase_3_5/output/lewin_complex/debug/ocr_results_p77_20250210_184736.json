Figure 3.6 sketches\nthis notion.\n\n(4, 1) (1D) Now? (ictus?)\n\n(GIS3 intervals (11, 1) and (2, 7)\n2.7 # e recur @ time-point 11.)\n| Sent SL |\n\nQ, 7)\nFIGURE 3.6\n\nThe ictus on C in figure 3.6 corresponds to a written barline; this was not\nthe case with the conflicting ictus on C# in figure 3.5, That C# was 5 beats after\nthe D-ictus of figure 3.4; the C of figure 3.6, which picks up the Hauptstimme\nD in register, is 6 beats after the D-ictus. The mensural conflict of \u201c5 units\nafter\u201d (D-ictus to C#-ictus) and \u201c6 units after\u201d (D-ictus to C-ictus) is highly\nthematic in op. 27 as a whole.\u00ae\n\nThe mensural reading of figure 3.6 tries to associate the C#\u2014C event in the\nmusic with the \u201caccompaniment figure,\u201d the figure that projected the B-Bp\nevent. In contrast, the mensural reading of figure 3.5 tried to associate the\nD-\u2014C# descent with the thematic Ep\u2014D descent. Figure 3.5, of course, \u2018\u201c\u2018did not\nknow about\u201d the forte and staccato C natural coming up right after the forte\nand staccato C#. We have already discussed how the recurrent GIS,-interval\n(2, 7) interacts with the accompaniment figure more generally.\n\nThis completes the exegesis of figure 3.3. The theoretical notion of an\n\u201cunfolding interval vector,\u201d made abstractly available by the temporal aspect\nof GIS,, was analytically useful for examining our impressions of figure 3.1 as\nthose developed note-by-note, and for discussing to a significant extent our\nimpressions of the music beyond that. GIS, was particularly useful because it\nenabled us to consider pitch-class structure and mensural rhythmic structure\nin conjunction with each other, rather than as independent features of the\npassage. That is the essence of GIS, in its capacity as what we shall soon call\nthe direct product of GIS, and GIS,.\n\n6. Aconflict between mensural distances of 5 and 6 units figures in the relation of the rhyth-\nmic ostinato to the written meter at the opening of the first movement. A reprise of this rhythmic\nconflict occurs at the opening of the coda in the last movement (mm. 56-62). The written meters\nare functional, in ways too complex to indicate here. Special accents attach to the loud and dense\ntrichord-pairs of the middle movement. The lower chords of the trichord-pairs attack at the bar-\nlines of measures 4, 9, 4 bis (6 measures after 9), 9 bis, 15, 20, 15 bis (6 measures after 20), and\n20 bis. The resulting pattern projects alternating spans of 5 and 6 written measures. Indeed this\nmay well be the strongest mensural function for the written measure as a temporal span in the\nTiovement.\n",
