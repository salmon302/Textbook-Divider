Musical chronology is naturally crucial.\nWe may hear a dominant precede its tonic, symbolized e.g. by the right-\npointing diagonal arrows on figure 7.10; we may hear a dominant follow and\ninflect its tonic, symbolized e.g. by the left-pointing arrows on figure 7.12.\nBut in this particular system of root-relations, the normative graph itself\ndisplays only a dominant node and a tonic node connected by a labeled\narrow; chronological distinctions in this system function not as norms but as\ndifferent interpretations of the normative graphs. That is a feature of classical\nfundamental-bass theory, not of our graphic structures per se. We have many\nsystems of rhythmic \u201cintervals\u201d at hand within which we could construct\nanalogous graphs that would enforce musical chronology.\n\nThe opening of the Minuet interprets the basic norm of figure 7.9 in the\nmanner of figures 7.11 and 7.12. The music specifically reads the normative\nnetwork as a backwards-laid-out CADENCE of local tonics (figure 7.12),\ndiminuted into two balanced fowards-laid-out CADENCEs of roots (figure\n7.11). We have already noted how the repeated G\u2014C progression within the\nMinuet theme helps to bring out this balanced structure. The idea of balance is\nalso projected melodically to some extent: The first CADENCE of roots\nharmonizes the tetrachord G-A-B-C in the principal melodic line; the sec-\nond CADENCE harmonizes the answering similar tetrachord D~E-F#~G.\nOf course the irrepressible thrust of the rising scale works against this feeling\nof balance, along with other features of the passage. It is curious that figure\n7.8(a), so ebullient in its texture, should project a reading of our underlying\nharmonic norm as balanced, while figure 7.8(b), so stately and measured in its\ntexture, should project a reading of the same norm as progressive.\n\nFigure 7.13 continues from the end of figure 7.8, asserting a structural\ncorrespondence between the next four measures of the Minuet, arriving at a\nstructural dominant, and the continuation of the first movement all the way\nup to the dominant which prepares the first big tonic tutti in the Allegro. The\ncorrespondences displayed here are mostly melodic, serial, and motivic, invol-\nving particularly the thematic leading-tone-to-tonic idea. Fundamental-bass\n\n173\n",
