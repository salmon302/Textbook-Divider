When we inquire about the\n2-note subsets of Z, we are inquiring about the boundary edges of this\ntetrahedron. The figure lays the boundary edges out for inspection below the\ntetrahedron. Of the six edges, one belongs to set-class 2-1, two belong to set-\nclass 2\u20142, two belong to set-class 2\u20143, and one belongs to set-class 2-5. The\nembedding numbers at the lower right of the figure express these counts.\n\nNow let us inspect figure 5.10. It first analyzes the tetrachord into its four\ntriangular boundary faces, and then analyzes each triangular face into its three\nboundary edges. Two of the triangles are in Forte-class 3-2; these triangles are\nlabelled Y2 and Y2\u2019 on the figure. The other two triangles are in Forte-class\n3-7; these triangles are labelled Y7 and Y7\u2019.\n\n109\n",
