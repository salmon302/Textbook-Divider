If D = (s, t)is an\nAOD, then the set class /D/ corresponds to the forwards-oriented interval\n(i, p) = int(s, t): Every member D\u2019 = (s\u2019, t\u2019) of /D/, when attack-ordered, has\nint(s\u2019, t') = (i, p); furthermore, if s\u2019 and t\u2019 are any time spans such that\nint(s\u2019, t\u2019) = Gi, p), then the AOD D\u2019 = (s\u2019,t\u2019) is a member of the set class /D/.\nThe forwards-oriented intervals thus play exactly the same role here that\nForte\u2019s \u201cinterval classes\u201d play in his atonal theory: They can be used to label\nthe distinct set-classes of dyads. They can be so used, that is, if we take the\ninterval-preserving operations as CANONical in constructing those set-\nclasses.\n\nAs a result of this structure, we can develop a very strong formal analog\nfor Forte\u2019s interval vector in this particular system (NB). Let X be a set\ncontaining more than two members; let D be a dyad; then EMB(D, X), the\nnumber of forms of D embedded within X, is equal to the number of ways the\nforwards-oriented interval (i, p) can be spanned between members of X, where\n(i, p) is the interval spanning the attack-ordered members of D. In other\nwords, EMB(D, X) = IFUNC(X, X)(i, p). In this sense we can speak of\nEMB(/D/, X), when /D/ varies over the dyad-classes, as an \u201cinterval vector;\u201d\n(i, p) will vary concomitantly over the forwards-oriented intervals. Let us\nstudy some actual interval vectors in this system by way of example.\n\nFIGURE 5.11\n\n5.4.1 Examp.e: Figure 5.11 shows the mensural skeletons for motives (b),\n(c), and (d) from the Chopin sonata studied earlier (in section 4.3). The\nrhythmic motives are modeled by sets of time spans, and their interval vectors\nare tabulated on figure 5.12.\n\nForming and reading these interval vectors becomes easy with practice.\nThe forwards-oriented interval (1, 1) labels the set-class of AODs D = (s, t)\nsuch that t begins right after s (1 s-length after s begins) and extends the same\nduration as s (1 times the length of's). Within set (b) we count three instances of\nsuch AODs. The AODs are formed by the first-and-second notes of the\nmotive, its third-and-fourth notes, and its fourth-and-fifth notes. Thus the\nnumber 3 is entered on the table of figure 5.12, in the row of the table headed\nby the interval (1, 1) and in the column of the table headed \u201cvector of (b).\u201d Set\n(c) includes only two AODs in the set-class (1, 1): the first two notes of motive\n(c), and the last two notes of the motive. Remember: A pair of successive\nquarter notes in any tempo at any point in the piece (or any other piece any\n",
