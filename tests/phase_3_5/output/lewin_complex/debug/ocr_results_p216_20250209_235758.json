The prime form that fills\nthe rightmost node of (b) launches the coda of the third movement and the\nentire piece. The total rhythm of this coda matches that of the first-movement\ntheme reprised at 1,37: In both cases we hear a rhythmic ostinato whose\nrepeated units project four attacks and a rest in steady note-values.\n\n8.2.4 If we excise any four consecutive nodes from figure 8.4(b), along with\nthe arrows that connect them, we shall have essentially the same graph as that\nof figure 8.3. The same transformations are arranged and combined in the\nsame structure of nodes and arrows, even though the contents of the nodes are\nWagnerian in one case and Webernian in the other. We shall say that the two\nnetworks-of-series are isographic. The isography would not obtain if we wrote\n\u201cT 9\u201d for TCH on figure 8.3 and \u201cT,\u201d for TCH on figure 8.4(b): T,9 and T,\nare not the same transformation.\n\n8.2.5 Exampie: Let us define another operation on series, an operation\ncalled MUCH. MUCH(s) is that retrograde-inverted form of s whose begin-\nning overlaps the ending of s to the maximum possible extent. Figure 8.5(a)\nshows how Bach chains MUCH and RICH in the first Two-Part Invention.\n\nFigure 8.5(b) shows Bach\u2019s transformational technique in a graph which\nis very similar to the earlier graphs involving RICH. OP is the transformation\nRICH-after-MUCH; OP\u2019 is the transformation MUCH-after-RICH. MUCH\nand RICH do not commute on the family of all series, but the OP-interval-of-\ntransposition for any given s is always the same as the OP\u2019-interval for the\n\nFIGURE 8.5 183\n",
