Given sets X and Y, suppose we\nare inspecting the values of INJ(X, Y)(f), INJCKX, X)(f), and INJ(Y, Y)(f) as f\nvaries over a certain family INSPECT of transformations.\n\nFor certain transformations f within the family INSPECT, the value of\nINJ(X, Y)(f) will be maximal, or at least relatively high subject to the con-\nstraints of the situation. We shall call these transformations progressive. They\nmap a lot of X into Y,\n\nFor certain transformations f within the family INSPECT, the value of\nINJ(X, Xf) or INICY, Y)f) will be high. We shall call these transformations\nX-internal or Y-internal accordingly. A transformation which is both X-\ninternal and Y-internal can be called \u201cinternal (for the progression X-\u2014Y).\u201d\nAn X-internal transformation maps a lot of X into X.\n\nIntuitively, an X-internal transformation tends to extend/elaborate/\ndevelop/prolong X in the music, while a progressive transformation tends to\nurge X onwards, to become something else (like Y).\n\nProgressive and internal transformations will tend to combine mathe-\nmatically in certain interrelated ways, by their very natures. If I transform X\nto be much like itself, and then transform the result to be much like itself, it is\nlikely that the composition of the two gestures will make X much like itself.\nThat is, the composition of two X-internal transformations will tend to be\nX-internal. Similarly, the inverse of an X-internal operation will tend to be\nX-internal. Similarly, an X-internal transformation followed by an X-Y-\nprogressive transformation will tend to be an X-Y-progressive transfor-\nmation; and an X\u2014Y-progressive transformation followed by a Y-internal trans-\nformation will tend to be X\u2014Y-progressive.\n\nAs a result, when we inspect the families of progressive and internal\ntransformations pertinent to a given X-Y situation, we shall find those\nfamilies tending to interrelate algebraically according to the considerations\njust surveyed.\n\nWe can introduce other useful nomenclature. An f such that INJCX,\nX)(f) is minimal or at least relatively small, given the constraints of X and\nINSPECT, can be called X-external. Such an f maps X largely outside itself.\nWe can also define a dispersive transformation to be one that maps X largely\noutside Y, makeing the value of INJ(X, Y)(f) minimal or relatively small.\nThese definitions avoid mentioning the complements of the sets X and Y in\nS, which may not be \u201csets\u201d according to our definition if S is infinite.\n\nExternal and dispersive transformations tend to enter into typical al-\ngebraic relations with themselves, with each other, and with internal and\nprogressive transformations. An X-internal transformation followed by an X-\nexternal one will tend to be X-external; a progressive transformation followed\nby a Y-external one will tend to be dispersive; and so on.\n\nA good example of dispersive transformations is furnished by measure 8\n",
