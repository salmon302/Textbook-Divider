We called graph (a) the \u2018\u2018comple-\nmentary gesture,\u201d and graph (b) the \u201ccomplementary gesture times 2.\u201d The\nintervallic augmentation that transforms graph (a) into graph (b) is in fact a\nformal homomorphism.\n\nTo verify this, let us begin by attaching the name (NODES, ARROW) to\nthe three-node node/arrow system common for both graphs. Take NODEMAP\nto be the identity map on NODES. NODEMAP is then, trivially, an isomor-\nphism of the node/arrow systems involved for the two graphs.\n\nTake SGP,, the semigroup for graph (a), to be the group of the twelve\nchromatic pitch-class intervals. Take SGP,, the semigroup for graph (b), to be\n(provisionally) the same group. The values of TRANSIT, and TRANSIT, are\nas indicated on graphs (a) and (b) of the figure. Take SGMAP to be the\nmapping of the interval i into the interval 2i, a map that transforms SGP,\ninto SGP,. That is, take SGMAP(i) = 2i for each interval i. Then SGMAP\nis a homomorphism of SGP, into SGP,: SGMAPG + j) = SGMAP(i) +\nSGMAP(}j) (mod 12). As defined, SGMAP is neither 1-to-1 nor onto.\n\nRequirements (A) and (B) for Definition 9.5.2 are now verified, as regards\na potential homomorphism of graph (a) into graph (b). It remains to verify\nrequirement (C) of the definition. This is easily done by inspecting the\n",
