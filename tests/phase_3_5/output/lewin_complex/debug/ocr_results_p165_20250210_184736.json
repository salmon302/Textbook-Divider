In this\ncontext the F flat of (9, Fp) in the melody is \u201ccorrect\u201d; it is in fact the goal of\nthe wedge. One notes the care with which the high Fb is distinguished by the\ncomposer from the low Fp.\n\nWhen we hear the penultimate Fb as \u201ccorrect\u201d and ignore the last dotted\narrow on figure 6.4, we get a sense of \u2018ordinal expansion\u201d over the phrase as\nregards not just w spans but also I spans. First I projects at ordinal distance 1\nand w at distance 2; next I projects at distance 2 and w at distance 3; finally I\nand w both project at distance 5, and w projects at distance 6.\n\nFIGURE 6.5\n\nThe injection function, like IFUNC earlier, enables us to discover and\nexplore relationships our ears might not otherwise pick up quickly. Figure\n6.5(a), for instance, elaborates on the observation that there are 4 transfor-\nmations f of form (n, T,) such that INJ(X#, X8)(f) is non-zero, allowing Fh\nto represent F natural. So there are four T, arrows on the figure, projecting all\nof X4 progessively into all of X8 at a variety of ordinal distances. This con-\ntrasts sharply with the absence of any I or w arrows on figure 6.4 that led from\nanywhere within X+ to anywhere within X8. So far as the two tetrads in the\nvocal melody are concerned, we may put it that I and w are \u201cinternal\u201d\ntransformations, while T, is \u201cprogressive.\u201d The structure of figure 6.5(a) is\nhard to pick up by ear alone because its predominant ordinal rhythm of\n\u201c3 later\u2019 conflicts both with the motivic rhythm of the music, and with the\n2-later rhythm established in figure 6.4 within X?.\n",
