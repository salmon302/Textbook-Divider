The interval from v to I(s), which is the\ninverse of int(I(s), v), will then be the same as the interval from s to u. Thatis, we\n\nintuit int(v, I(s)) = int(s, u). We can use this equation to define It, formally in\nany GIS.\n\n3.5.1 Derinition: Given any u in S and any v in S, the operation It, of u/v\ninversion is defined by the equation\n\nint(v, I\u00a5(s)) = int(s,u) for alls.\n\nThe operation is well defined by the equation: Given any s, set i=\nint(s, u) and find the unique t which lies the interval i from v. That t, which\nsatisfies the equation int(v, t) = int(s, u), is precisely the value for I'(s).\n\nWe have been referring to the \u201coperation\u201d I} prematurely; so far we have\nconstructed a transformation, but we have not verified that the transforma-\ntion is indeed an operation, i.e. onto and 1-to-1. The reader may verify, as an\nexercise, that If, as defined is onto and 1-to-1. (Given t, find an s such that\nIX(s) = t. Prove that if If(s\u2019) = T{(s), then s\u2019 = s.)\n\n3.5.2 THEOREM: Fix a referential element ref of S. Set i = LABEL(v) and\nj = LABEL(u). Then\nLABEL(I\\(s)) = i: LABEL(s)7? -j.\nProof: To save space, we write \u201cI\u201d for \u201c1%\u201d here.\n\nint(v, I(s)) = int(s,u) (3.5.1). So\nint(v, ref)int(ref, I(s)) = int(s, ref)int(ref,u) (2.3.1(A)).\n\nThence,\nLABEL(v)\"!LABEL(I(s)) = LABEL(s)\"!LABEL(u) (3.1.1; 2.3.2)\n\nOr: i-?- LABEL(I(s)) = LABEL(s)\"! -j\nOr: LABEL(I(s)) = i: LABEL(s)\"? - j q.e.d.\n\nJl\n",
