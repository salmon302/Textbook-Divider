It brings out a clear isography between\nthe passages. Figure 8.2a in the book is not a well-formed \u201cgraph\u201d by the later defi-\nnition. (SUBM is not = LT SUBD on major as well as minor Klangs: (C,+)\nSUBM = (e,\u2014) but (C,+)LT SUBD = (e,\u2014)SUBD = (b,\u2014).) The symbol \u201c(G,\u2014)\u201d\non figure 8.2a is a misprint for (G#,\u2014).! The discussion of section 8.1.2, pages\n179-180, still applies: a group that contains L, S, and +\u2014 operations on Klangs\nwill not be simply transitive in equal temperament. (For instance, (C,+)SSSS\n=(E,+), but (C,+)L +\u2014 also = (E,+).)\n\n1. See item 1 in the foreword, p. x.\n",
