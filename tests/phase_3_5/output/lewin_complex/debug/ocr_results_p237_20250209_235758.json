But the homomorphism of\nthe graphs does not depend formally upon the CONTENTS with which the\nnodes are filled in the networks. The graphs as such know nothing of these\ncontents; they know only the node/arrow systems, the semigroups involved in\nlabeling the arrows, and the TRANSIT functions that provide those labels.\n\n9.5.5 EXAMPLE: Figure 9.8(a) transcribes the opening phrase from the first\nexample in the Scholica Enchiriadis that shows the Symphony of the Diates-\nseron.\u201d (b) of the figure graphs the melody \u201cNos qui vivimus\u201d; the numbers\nmeasure steps up or down in the mode. (c) of the figure is a network whose\nnode/arrow system is disconnected; the network exhibits the vocal lines of\nPrincipalis and Organalis separately. Graph (b) is a homomorphic image of\ngraph (c). The homomorphism works as follows: NODEMAP takes the first\nPrincipalis node of (c) and the first Organalis node of (c) both into the first\nnode of (b); NODEMAP takes the second Principalis node and the second\nOrganalis node of (c) both into the second node of (b); and so on; SGMAP is\nthe identity map of SGP onto itself, where SGP is the pertinent group of\nintervals, that is the group of distances in steps up a scale.\n\nGraph (b) is however xot a homomorphic image of graph (d) under the\nanalogous NODEMAP. For thereis no possible SGMAP, mapping our inter-\nvals homomorphically into themselves, that satisfies both SGMAP(1) = 1 and\nSGMAP(3) = 0. Any homomorphism SGMAP that satisfies SGMAP(1) =\n1 must satisfy SGMAP() = SGMAP(1 + 1 + 1) = SGMAP(I) +\nSGMAP(1) + SGMAP(1) = 14141 =3.\n\nThe graph of (d) can be constructed as a formal \u201cproduct\u201d of graph (b)\nwith graph (e). But that is quite another matter. Network (d) must be distin-\n\n2. The transcription is taken from Oliver Strunk, Source Readings in Music History (New\nYork: W. W. Norton, 1950), p. 130.\n",
