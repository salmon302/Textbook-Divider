Nor do I believe that we intuit a path in harmonic space\nwhich corresponds directly to a compound series of individual multiplications\nand divisions by 2, 3, and 5. That is, if we take the 5th partial of the 3rd partial\nof the 3rd partial of C4, and then find the frequency of which that is the 2nd\npartial, and then find the frequency of which that is the 2nd partial, continuing\non in this way and so arriving eventually at F#4, I do not believe that the way\nof getting from C4 to F#4 which we have intellectually reconstructed in\nharmonic space is in any sense an intuition of distance or gesture being\nmeasured by the composite ratio 45/32 = 5 times 3 times 3 divided by 2\ndivided by 2 and so on.\n\nIn order to describe an actual harmonic intuition, I would rather proceed\nas follows. When we hear or imagine the succession C4\u2014F #4 in its own context\nand try to intuit a harmonic sensation, we intuit a tonic followed by the leading\ntone of its dominant. And we intuit the secondary leading tone harmonically\nas the third of a harmony whose root is the dominant of the dominant. Con-\nstructing a fundamental bass representative for that root, i.e. some D below\nthe F#4, we will locate that D in register as D3, to keep it completely beneath\nthe \u201csoprano line\u201d C4\u2014F #4. For the same reason, in constructing a funda-\nmental bass for the note G4 that we imagine following F#4 in the soprano, a\nfundamental bass representing the implicit role of dominant harmony in the\ncontext, we will locate the bass G as G3, In this way we intuit the enlarged\nharmonic context of figure 2.1(a) from the given stimulus C4-F #4.\n\nFIGURE 2.1\n\nThe arrows on figure 2.1(b) show the path in harmonic space which I\nbelieve we actually intuit in this enlarged context. Starting at C4 as a local\ntonic, the first arrow takes us to G3, a fundamental bass for the dominant\nharmony where we hear the implicit enlarged context closing. The second\narrow shows G3 inflected by its own dominant immediately preceding; the\narrow points to the fundamental bass D3 for that event. The third arrow\npoints to F#3, the major third of the harmony over D3. The fourth arrow\npoints to F#4, the octave above F#3, Collating the entire path, we can retrace\nit and express it in prose: F#4 lies an octave above the major third of that\n",
