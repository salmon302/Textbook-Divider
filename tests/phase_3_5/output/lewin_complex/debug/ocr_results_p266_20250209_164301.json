The way in which\nZ, pulls together the pitches and intervals of X, Y, T(X), and the repeat of\nthose cells is aurally clear. The transformational! situation is already so com-\nplex that it would require an inordinate amount of discussion to describe this\nsynthesis adequately in words. Let us just explore a few of its features, as\ndisplayed by figure 10.12.\n\n) T* (as when T (X) returned to X)\n(as within T (X)) (AD)\n\nT\u2019 (as within X)\n\nT 1\n(as within Y)\n\nFIGURE 10.12\n\nThe T\u2122 relation from F to Ep, which we heard within Y, is recapitulated\nat the opening of Z,. The T~\u2019 relation from Bb to Ab, which we heard when\nT(X) returned to X at measure 5, is recapitulated by the last two notes of Z,.\nAnd the relation between those two T~! relations, within Z,, is an inverse T\u2019-\nrelation. Figure 10.12 shows how this recalls the T\u2019-features of X and T(X).\n\nBeneath Z, in the accompaniment, a new idea makes its appearance. This\nidea involves a continuous chromatic rise of a certain object (here a certain\n3-note chord), over a total span of three semitones. The graph of this idea will\nbe called CHR; it is depicted in figure 10.13.\n\n1 1 1\n\u00a9 ns \u00a9 ens \u00a9 \u00a9)\n\nll\n\n3\n\nFIGURE 10.13\n\n233\n",
