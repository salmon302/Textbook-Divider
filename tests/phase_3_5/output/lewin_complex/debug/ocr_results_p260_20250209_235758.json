Among its\ninput and output chords, figure 10.6 manifests a classical \u201ctriple proportion\u201d:\nC#\u00a5-D#-F# (input) is to F*-G#-B (output) as GH-A#-C# (input) is to\nC#-D#-F# (output). The triple proportion also involves an isography of the\nleft side, on figure 10.6, with the right side, on the same figure. That is, the\nrelation of the material grouped by the two right-hand beams, over measures\n11-25 on figure 10.5, is an isography. Intervals of 5 span the trichords and\n(therefore) measure the TCH-transpositions, They make the triple proportion\nhere sound almost like I-[V-V-I, especially since the pitch class F#, appear-\ning at the bottom of the first \u2018I\u2019? and at the top of the final \u201cI\u201d in the\nJ-IV-V-I, has a certain tonicity about it as regards the pitch structure of the\nright hand. Perhaps this sound led Travis to hear a functional I-IV-V-I\ngoverning the tonal structure of the piece as a whole.\n\n10.3. Exampte: Figure 10.7 sketches aspects of the opening seven measures\nfrom the first of Prokofieff\u2019s Melodies op. 35. I am indebted to Neil Minturn\nfor bringing this passage to my attention. The four-flat signature on the figure\nis mine; Prokofieff writes no signature.\n\nThe harmony in the music is far from traditional. Yet it is diatonic\nenough, and the outer voices are diatonic enough, so that some harmonic\nevents stand out as \u201c\u2018strange.\u201d Foremost among these are the cadence har-\nmonies, E minor over the last half of measure 2 and Eb minor over the last half\nof measure 5. At both these cadences we expect Ep-major harmony.\n\nWe can analyze the cadential substitutions by using the terminology of\nKlangs and Klang-transformations. The network of figure 10.8(a) does so,\nand also brings the D-major Klang of measure 6 into the picture: D major, the\nSLIDE transform of Ep minor, bears to the latter Klang the same relation\n\n227\n",
