But the function of the Klang as\nCONTENTS (left node) is different from its function as CONTENTS (right\nnode). In the former capacity, the Klang is an input; in the latter capacity it is\nan output.\n\nThe input and output functions for (C, +) in the network reflect very\nwell in this setting two of the three principal ideas about tonicity that have\ngoverned most theories of tonality since the eighteenth century. The input\nfunction reflects the idea of tonic-as-generator, a tonic that asserts itself in the\nvery act of sounding a tone, setting a musical process in action, a tonic which\ngenerates other tones through that action. The output function reflects the\nidea of tonic-as-goal, a tonic that appears at the end of a completed gesture as\na point of repose towards which events have been moving. The third principal\nidea asserts as tonic a center of balance in a well-balanced structure. That idea,\ntoo, is manifest in the visual aspect of figure 9.10: The figure balances about\nthe two nodes containing (C, +).\n\nWe cannot completely translate out input/output formalities into ideas\nabout tonicity. For instance we do not want to assert (G, +) or (F, +) on\nfigure 9.10 as \u201ctonics,\u201d even though the former Klang fills an input node and\nthe latter Klang an output node. Nevertheless the input/output formalities are\nsuggestive in connection with tonal theory.\n\n9.6.4 Examp te: Figure 9.11 shows a network whose nodes are filled by forms\nof the FATE motive from the opening of Die Walkiire, act 2, scene 4, the\n\u2018\u201c*Todesverkiindigung.\u201d We discussed this network in connection with figure\n8.6 earlier,\n\nThe horizontal arrows on the figure are labeled by the TRANSIT-\noperation RICH; the curved arrows are labeled by TCH.
