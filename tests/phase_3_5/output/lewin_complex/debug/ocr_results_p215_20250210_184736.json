During our earlier discussion\nof the passage, we pointed out how the chaining technique creates structural\nsequencing as a result. We can \u201chear\u201d the structural sequence in the note\nheads of figure 7.4, even though the foreground events of the music over\nmeasures 1074\u20141100 are quite different from those of the music over measures\n1096-1140.\n\n8.2.3. ExampLe: Webern is fond of using RICH and TCH, especially as row-\ntransformations in his serial works. Figure 8.4 graphs two instances from the\nPiano Variations. (a) of the figure coincides with the thematic middle section\nof the first movement; (b) coincides with the frantically syncopated variation\nin the last movement.\n\nThe nodes on figure 8.4 are understood to contain various forms of the\nrow. On (a) of the figure, T, is not TCH. The row-form that fills both the\nleftmost and the rightmost nodes of (b) is the prime row-form cited earlier, the\nform which opens the third movement. The same form also fills the rightmost\nnode of (a). This is the first occurrence of the prime form in the piece; after\n\na)\nI, 19-37\n\nb)\nIII, 42-58\n\nstraight arrows = RICH\ncurved arrows = TCH\n\nFIGURE 8.4\n",
