Let us study some examples to see how it applies to that theory; the\nreader may thereby see the point of the construction, both in that specific\napplication and more generally.\n\nFIGURE 5.1\n\nFigure 5.1(a) displays the two pitch-class sets X, = (E, Bp) and Y, =\n(F, A, C#) as a sort of symbolic melodic antecedent and consequent. Arrows\ndrawn from each note of X, to each note of Y, show which intervals can be\nspanned, how many ways, between notes of X, and notes of Y,. Here, the\neven-numbered intervals cannot be spanned at all, and each odd-numbered\ninterval can be spanned in exactly one way. Hence IFUNC(X,, Y,)() = 0if\niis even, and = 1 if iis odd.\n\nFigure 5.1(b) displays the two sets X, (as before) and Y, = (G, A, B)ina\nsimilar format. We see that IFUNC(X,, Y,)(i) also = Oifiis even, and = 1 if\niis odd. So IFUNC(X,, Y,) = IFUNC(X,, Y,) as a function on IVLS, even\nthough Y, is not the same set as Y,\u2014-indeed, Y, is not even a form of Y,.?\n\nFigure 5,1(c) displays the new sets X, and Y, in the same format. Here\nX, is different from X, and Y, is different from either Y, or Y,; yet\nJFUNC(X,, Y;) is again the same function of i: Its value is 0 if i is even and\n1 if iis odd.\n\nFigure 5,1(d) displays yet another pair of sets, X, = (Ep, F,G, A, B, C#)\nand Y, = (E). The X,/Y, interval function is still and again the same:\nIFUNC(X3, Y,)(i) is 0 ifi is even, 1 ifi is odd. The set X, here is of different\n\n2. Jinvestigated this sort of phenomenon in an early article, \u201cIntervallic Relations between\nTwo Collections of Notes,\u201d Journal of Music Theory, vol. 3, no. 2 (November 1959), 298-301. Its\nstyle, unfortunately, makes few concessions to a non-mathematical reader.\n\n89\n",
