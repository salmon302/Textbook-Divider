At\nthis time (i.e. just after time-point 3), we become aware of a 2-element S,-set,\nthat is, the set ((Eb, 0), (B, 3)). The elements of this set form one GIS,-interval\nwith a positive time-component, that ts, the interval (8,3) from (Eb,0) to\n(B, 3). The GIS,-interval (8, 3) is listed in the second row of the second column\nin figure 3.3; that interval is the sole constituent within the interval vector of\nthe 2-element S,-set.\n\nNow the pitch class Bp occurs at time-point 4, providing the new\nS, element (Bb, 4) for the third row of column 1 on figure 3.3. At this\ntime (i.e. just after time-point 4), we become aware of a 3-element S,-set,\n((Eb, 0), (B, 3), (Bp, 4)). Besides the GIS,-interval of (8,3) already listed in\nrow 2, the elements of the 3-member set produce new GIS,-intervals of (7,4)\n(= int,((Eb, 0), (Bb, 4))) and (11, 1)(= int, ((B, 3), (Bp, 4))). These new con-\nstituents for the interval vector of the expanded 3-element S,-set are listed in\nthe third row of column 2 on figure 3.3; the old interval vector expands to\ninclude the occurrences of the two new intervals.\n\nWhen pitch class D enters at time-point 5, the 3-element S,-set expands\nto a 4element S3-set ((Eb, 0), (B, 3), (Bb, 4), (D, 5)), and the interval vector\nof the 3-element set expands to adjoin new occurrences of the GIS,-intervals\n(11, 5)(= ints((Ep, 0),(D,5))), (3, 2)(= int,((B, 3), (D, 5))), and (4,1)\n(= int,((Bp, 4), (D, 5))). The new intervals are listed in the fourth row of\ncolumn 2, on figure 3.3. At this time (i.e. just after time-point 5), we become\n\n4l\n",
