The leftmost side of figure 7.9 exhibits CADENCE\nformatting the subnetwork C-\u2014F; G\u2014C. The rightmost side of figure 7.9\nexhibits CADENCE formatting the subnetwork G-\u2014C; D-G. This suggests\nhearing the entire normative network of figure 7.9 (without tail) as comprising\ntwo CADENCEs, the right side of the first CADENCE being elided into the\nleft side of the second CADENCE. According to this reading, figure 7.9\nwithout tail is to be understood as a contraction of figure 7.11.\n\nFIGURE 7.11\n\nThis interpretation of figure 7.9 illuminates the repeated G-\u2014C pro-\ngression within the Minuet theme, marked by the brackets on figure 7.8(a):\nThat projects the normative repeated G\u2014C progression which we see on figure\n7.1L.\n\nThe pitch classes that fill the nodes of figure 7.11 are the roots of various\nharmonies. Some harmonies are (local) tonics; others are dominants. The\ntonic pitch classes fill nodes that have arrowheads pointing to them. Figure\n7.12 isolates the tonics of figure 7.11 and organizes them in a network of their\nown.\n\nThis network in fact fills the nodes of the CADENCE graph (figure 7.10)\nyet again. The relation is hard to see because the diagonal arrows of figure 7.10\ngo to the right while those of figure 7.12 go to the left. But the CADENCE\n",
