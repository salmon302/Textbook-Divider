All the AODs just indicated\nbelong to the same set-class, the set-class determined by the interval (1, 1)\nbetween the first and second members of each AOD. The two AODs of class\n(1, 1) embedded in set (c) are counted on figure 5.12 by the number 2, entered\nto the right of the interval (1, 1) and in the column headed \u201cvector of (c).\u201d Set\n(d) also embeds two AODs of class (1, 1), namely the pair of half notes and\nthe pair of whole notes at the end of the motive.\n\nLet us now consider the set-class corresponding to the forwards-oriented\ninterval (3, 2). An AOD D = (s, t) belongs to this class if t begins 3 s-spans\nlater than s begins, and lasts twice as long as s. The second quarter of (c) and\nthe first half-note of (c) form such an AOD. So do the last quarter of (c) and the\nsecond half-note of (c). These two dyads are tabulated by the entry 2 in the\n(3, 2)-row and the (c)-vector-column of figure 5.12. The entry of 1 in the\n(1%, %)-row arises from the AOD formed by the first and third notes of\nmotive (d).\n\nIn section 4.3 we noted a progressive \u201cexpansion\u201d from motive (b), through\nmotives (c) and (d). The progressive broadening of note values, from eighths\nto quarters to halves to whole notes, is obviously crucial. Our model does\nnot address this aspect of the progression. But it does address and ana-\nlyze well another aspect of interest, something we might call the \u201cprogres-\n\niS\n",
