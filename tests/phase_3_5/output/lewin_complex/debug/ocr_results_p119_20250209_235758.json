(b) symbolizes the motive of the first theme.\n(c) symbolizes a motive from the end of the bridge, and (d) symbolizes the\nmotive of the second theme. At the end of the exposition there is a big push to\ncadence, leading to a big dominant of Dp major. Then there is a repeat sign,\nChopin\u2019s notation is ambiguous; for this discussion J will assume what I hear\nstrongly in any case, that the repeat goes back to (a), rather than (b). Then the\nopening note of (a) completes the Dp cadence; one thereby hears Fb as the\nsecond note of (a) all the more strongly, since it is a third of the tonicized Dp,\ndespite the notated E natural and the subsequent leading of the note as E\nnatural in the bass line.\n\nHere is the assertion I wish to study: The first melodic dyad of (b),\nmarked y on the figure, belongs to the same interval class as x, the first melodic\ndyad of (a). This relation, like the relation of our four sin tones earlier, is\nformally \u201ctrue\u201d but intuitively problematic. At least, the relation of x and y\ndyads is hard to hear when we first hear the first theme, the first time through\nthe exposition. But, I claim, the asserted relation has the potential for becom-\ning audible, and in fact it does become audible, even highly significant, the\nsecond time through the exposition.\n\nTo hear this one should take motive (b), rather than motive (a), as a point\nof departure. By the end of the bridge section, motive (b) has been trans-\nformed into motive (c). Rhythmically, (c) augments the durations of (b) by a\nfactor of 2, and then augments its own last two notes by yet another factor of\n2. Motive (d) introduces the second theme immediately thereafter. Rhythmi-\ncally, (d) augments (c) by yet another factor of 2, and exchanges the durations\nof the first two notes (counting the rest as part of the note that precedes it).\nAnd then, going around the repeat, motive (a) augments (d) rhythmically by\nstill another factor of 2. Thus the chain of motive-forms (b)\u2014(c)\u2014(d)\u2014(a bis) is\ngenerated by a very consistent, indeed relentless, process of rhythmic expan-\nsion. After the repeat, when we continue on from (a bis) to (b bis), we are\nleaping from the end of the chain (b)\u2014(c)\u2014(d)\u2014(a), back to its beginning and\n",
