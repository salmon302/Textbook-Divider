Over measures | through 3 the music\nslowly exposes the set Wy = (A, Bb, Ap). (At the written tempo, this takes\nover 20 seconds.) The boundary tones for the exposition of W, are shown on\nthe figure with open noteheads: A is lowest and first; Ab is (so far) highest and\nlast. As the piece continues, the rhythm becomes more active and the registral\nspace expands. By the cadence at measure 5 we hear new boundary tones, also\nshown with open noteheads: Ep5 is a new highest tone; D3 is a new lowest tone\nand also a new last tone.
