Since we are assuming\njust intonation, the frequencies involved will differ by factors involving the\nsyntonic comma and the pitch classes C_,, C,, C,, ... will be distinct acousti-\ncally. But even in equal temperament, the visual format of figure 2.2 portrays\na conceptually infinite harmonic space, whose distinct places correspond to\nsubscripted pitch-classes. (Subscripted pitch-classes can be expressed formally\nas ordered pairs; for example A}, can be expressed as the pair (A}, 3).)\n\nWe can conceptualize the intervals of modular harmonic space as charac-\nteristic \u201cmoves\u201d on the game board of figure 2.2. For example, in going from\nC, to F\u00a5,, we move 2 squares to the right and 1 square up. The number-pair\n(2, 1), which is int(C,, F#,), can thereby be conceptualized as a label for this\nparticular form of the \u201cknight\u2019s move\u201d on the game board, i.e. the knight\u2019s\nmove east by northeast. The same move (interval) takes us from A, to Di, or\nfrom Dh_, to Go.\n\nal\n",
