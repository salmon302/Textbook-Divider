In this connection, it is interesting to study\n\u201cinput nodes\u201d and \u201coutput nodes\u201d for node/arrow systems, and hence for\ngraphs and networks that involve those systems.\n\n9.6.1 Derinition: An input node for a node/arrow system is a node IN to\nwhich no proper arrows point. That is, if (N, IN) is in the ARROW relation,\nwe must have N = IN. Analogously, an output node is a node OUT from\nwhich no proper arrows issue. That is, if (OUT, N) is in the ARROW relation,\nwe must have N = OUT.\n\n9.6.2 Examp Le: In the network of figure 9.9, the node on the left is an input\nnode and the node on the right is an output node.\n\nao \u2122\nCay, ta.

In discussing figure 7.7(g) earlier, we noted how the\nmotif of the Bb octave-leap, when led into the complementary gesture,\ngenerates the pitch class Gp. And we explored some consequences of that\ngeneration. Here we can note that our intuitions about \u201cputting in\u201d Bh and\n\u201cgetting out\u201d Gp correspond nicely to the formal input and output functions\nof the left hand and right hand nodes on figure 9.9.\n\n9.6.3 EXAMPLE: Figure 9.10 shows a network of Klangs whose graph we\n\nGN\nDOM\n(n\u2014>) (\u2014+ out)\nDOM \\,\n\nFIGURE 9.10 207\n",
