This is due in part to the foundational nature of the book\u2019s subject matter.\nThe work, a methodical examination of the concept of a musical interval, explores\nhow the familiar notion of interval as \u201ca distance extended between pitches in a\nCartesian space\u201d is merely one specific case of a more general idea, one that can\nembrace different kinds of musical objects (durations, meters, Klangs, timbres,\nand so on), different (i.e. non-Euclidean) geometries, and different orientational\nperspectives (interval as action or gesture rather than as simply measurement of\ndistance between things). Along the way, the work recasts set theory, the concepts\nof transposition and inversion, and notions of musical time in this generalized\nimage. But the work has maintained its relevance and importance as well because\nof the brilliance and musicality of its author. David had a gift for finding musically\nsignificant examples for his sometimes abstract concepts, and a gifted musical\nimagination that delighted in finding new ways to hear and understand familiar\nmusical passages. While GMIT does not offer the extended musical analyses of\nhis later books, Musical Form and Transformation or Studies in Music with Text,\nthe work is nonetheless rich with smaller analytical gems.\n\nTo be sure, transformational theory has evolved in the years since GMIT first\nappeared\u2014the analytical use of Klumpenhouwer networks, the development of\nneo-Riemannian theory, and the resurgence of spatial methodologies and metaphors\nin analysis all postdate David\u2019s seminal study. But each of these subsequent de-\nvelopments can find its basis in the framework David sets forth in GMIT: Klum-\npenhouwer networks apply the Generalized Interval System (GIS) concept recur-\nsively to create networks of networks; neo-Riemannian theory, which emerged from\nexplorations begun in chapter 8 of GMIT, takes families of contextual transforma-\n",
