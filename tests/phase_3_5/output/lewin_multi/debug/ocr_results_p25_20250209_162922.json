It is our desired\ngroup G. A specimen member of G can be written in\n\nCANONICAL FORM: ADD{j0,0} ADD{j3,3} ADD{j6,6}\nADD{j9,9} X{p}.\n\nThe chromatic scale is one SPECIAL row. It is straightforward, if tedious, to\nshow that given any SPECIAL row s, there is a unique member of our group G\nwhich transforms s into the chromatic scale. (Set kO = s(0), k3 = s(3), k6 = s(6),\nk9 = s(9); since s is SPECIAL, each of the k\u2019s must lie within a different aug-\nmented triad; apply four appropriate ADDs to obtain a new s\u2019 in which the set of\nk'-values is 0,3,6, and 9; permute the row s\u2019 into the chromatic scale. Etc. etc.) It\nfollows that the group G is simply transitive on SPECIAL rows: given any two\nSPECIAL rows s and t, there is a unique member of G, in the canonical form\nabove, which transformes s to t. (Transform s into the chromatic scale; then trans-\nform the chromatic scale into t.)\n\nThus the family of SPECIAL rows has a natural GIS structure, as discussed\nabove. The group G has cardinality 81-times-24 = 1944; that then is also the num-\nber of SPECIAL rows.\n\nSPECIAL rows become more interesting when one notes their relation to\n\u201csemi-Mallalieu\u201d rows. Andrew Mead, in excellent work as yet unpublished, has\ninvestigated semi-Mallalieu rows exhaustively; some interesting insight can be\nshed on his work by placing it in a GIS setting.> Pertaining to our SPECIAL rows\nare those semi-Mallalieu rows whose every-third-note transform is identical with\ntheir T4-transposition. Every-ninth-note of such a row will then be its T8-trans-\nposition. (Every-ninth-note = retrograde-of-every-fourth-note.)\n\nSuch a row, for example, is a premise of my piano piece Just a Minute, Roger\n{PNM 16.2 (SS 1978), 143-45]: 0b45732681a9. Right at the opening of the piece,\none hears quite clearly that every-third-note of this row is its T4-transpose: in\nmeas, 1-4 (music example 3a), the total texture is governed by the row, while the\nright hand picks out every-third-note, thereby projecting T4-of-the-row. Later on,\nin meas. 30-35 (example 3b), the total texture is governed by the T4-form of the\nrow, while the right hand picks out every-fourth-note-of-T4, thereby projecting\nthe retrograde of every-ninth-note-of-T4 = the retrograde of T8(T4) = the retro-\ngrade of the original row.\n\nWe shall focus in on these rows for the nonce, calling them SEMI-MALLALIEU.\nThe point is, that the family of SEMI-MALLALIEU rows and the family of SPE-\nCIAL rows, along with their characteristic properties, are mathematically equivalent\nin structure under a transformation that makes each row in one family correspond\n\n3.
