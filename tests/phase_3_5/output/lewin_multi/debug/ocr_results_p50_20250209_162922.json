The intervallic mea-\nsurements of the model thus interact effectively with ordinary arithmetic. This\nobviates a defect in the traditional measurements which tell us, for example,\nthat a \u201c3rd\u201d and another \u201c3rd\u201d compose to form a \u201cSth.\u201d (3 + 3 = 5 272)\n\n2.1.2 EXAMPLE: The musical space is a gamut of chromatic pitches under\ntwelve-tone equal temperament. Given pitches s and t, int(s, t) is the number\nof semitones one must move in an upwards-oriented sense to get from s to t,\nnot counting s itself. Thus int(C4, D4) = 2, int(C4, G4) = 7, int(C4, C5) =\n12, int(C4, F3) = \u20147, and int(C4, F2) = \u201419.\n\n2.1.3. EXAMPLE: The musical space comprises the twelve pitch-classes under\nequal temperament. If we arrange the pitch classes around the face of a clock\nfollowing the order of a chromatic scale, then int(s, t) is the number of hours\nthat we traverse in proceeding clockwise from s to t. For instance, if s is at 8\no'clock and t is at 1 o\u2019clock, int(s, t} = 5. Note that the number int(s, t) does\nnot depend on which pitch class is positioned at 12 o\u2019clock. In any case,\nint(E, E) = 0, int(E, F) = 1, and int(F, E) = 11.\n\n2.1.4 EXAMPLE: The musical space comprises seven pitch-classes, corre-\nsponding to the seven mode degrees of system 2.1.1. If we wrap the scale\naround the face of a seven-hour clock, then int(s, t) is the number of hours\nthat we traverse on that clock, in proceeding clockwise from s to t. Thus\nint((D, D) = 0, int(D, E) = 1, and int(D, C) = 6.\n\nWe could produce analogs for the linear spaces of examples 2.1.1 and\n2.1.2, using other sorts of scales. And, for systems in which octave equivalence\nis functional, we could derive analogs for the modular spaces of examples\n2.1.3 and 2.1.4. For example, we could investigate octatonic-scale space in the\nmanner of 2.1.1 and 2.1.2; we could derive there from a modular space of eight\npitch-classes, wrapping the octatonic scale around an eight-hour clock and\nmeasuring intervals modulo 8.\n\n2.1.5 EXAMPLE: This musical space, harmonic rather than melodic, com-\nprises pitches available from a given pitch using just intonation. If we write\nFQ(s) to denote the fundamental frequency of the pitch s, then int(s, t) is the\nquotient FQ(t)/FQ(s). That quotient will be some number of the form 2*3\u00b05\u00b0,\nwhere a, b, and c are integers, positive, negative, or zero.\n\nIt is not immediately clear what intuitions of \u201cdistance\u201d or \u201cmotion\u201d\nwe are measuring by these intervals. Personally, I am convinced that our\nintuitions are highly conditioned by cultural factors. In particular, I do not\nthink that the acoustics of harmonically vibrating bodies provide in them-\nselves an adequate basis for grounding those intuitions. For instance, when we\n\n17\n",
