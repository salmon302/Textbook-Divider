By \u201c\u2018local,\u201d I mean here not only over a certain\ntemporally connected section of the total texture, but possibly also within a\ncertain part, instrument, or instrumental group. For example, there is a more\nthan clear mensural structure within the part played by any single metronome\nwithin Ligeti\u2019s piece. For some less extreme examples let us return once more\nto figure 4.1, the Carter passage discussed before. The viola moves in notes of\nconstant duration from its entrance at measure 25 up to the middle of measure\n35; these local time-units \u2018\u201c\u2018beat\u2019\u2019 the tempo of MM 180. The first violin \u2018\u2018beats\u201d\nconstant local time-units at MM36 over measures 22-30, except for the A of\nmeasure 26 and the G of measure 28 which, as observed earlier, are each half\nthe local time-unit in duration. At measure 33 the first violin starts to project a\nnew constant local time-unit, that beats at MM90. The cello beats constant\nlocal time-units at MM 120 over measures 22-26; then over measures 27-31 it\nbeats new constant local time-units at MM48. Finally at measure 32 and\nfollowing, it stops moving in notes of constant duration as it plays a pitch-\nvariation on measures 27ff., where MM48 began. This variation was discussed\nearlier. The second violin beats its own constant local time-unit at MM96\nfrom measure 22 through measure 26. Then over measures 27-30 it runs\nquickly through a number of local time-units at MM120, MM160 (m. 274),\nMM96 (m. 284), MM80 (to be discussed later), and MM60 (m. 30). Finally it\nsettles into a more stable local time unit in measure 31, beating at MM90.\n\n4, Some of Nancarrow\u2019s recent work involves irrational proportions like x. For the reader\nwho may at first think such an idea is too bizarre to have any musical meaning, I append a brief\nexercise in conducting the tempo relation of x. Imagine a horizontal line segment at chest height,\nin front of you and somewhat to your right. (I am supposing that you conduct right-handed.)\nMove your hand (arm) back and forth along the line at a constant speed, beating a horizontal 2\nallegro vivo. Now imagine the line segment as a radius of a circle whose center is at the leftmost\npoint of your beat. As you reach the rightmost point of your beat, start swinging your hand (arm)\naround and around the circumference of that circle counterclockwise, taking care always to keep\nyour hand moving at the same constant speed. The amount of time it takes you to swing once\naround the circle is z times the duration of your earlier horizontal 2? measure.\n\n5. The composer specifies very precisely how this is to be done. He also specifies that the\npiece is to be played after an intermission, so that the returning audience finds the metronomes\nalready underway, with no persons on stage. The metronomes are to be arranged on risers, like a\nchorus; the slow beaters are at the lowest level and the fast beaters at the highest. I am indebted to\nMartin Bresnick for supplying me with this report, based on a personal communication from the\ncomposer.\n\n67\n",
