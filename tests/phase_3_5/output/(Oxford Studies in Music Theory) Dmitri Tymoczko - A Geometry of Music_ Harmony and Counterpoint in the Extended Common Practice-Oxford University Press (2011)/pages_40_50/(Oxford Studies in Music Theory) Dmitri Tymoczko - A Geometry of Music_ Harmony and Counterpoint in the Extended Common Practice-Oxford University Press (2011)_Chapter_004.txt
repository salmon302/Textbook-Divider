4 Consequently, pitch-class space is circular only in an abstract sense. One shouldn’t think of it as being 
embedded in a larger two-dimensional space, the way an ordinary circle exists on a two-dimensional piece 
of paper. Instead, one should think of it as a one-dimensional space unto itself. Here it can be useful to imag-
ine a pointlike inhabitant of the space: from its perspective, “circularity” consists in the fact that a “straight 
line”—for example, a counterclockwise path—eventually returns to its starting point.
