3 Here I am using scientiﬁ c pitch notation, in which numbers refer to octaves, with octave 4 ranging 
from middle C to the B above and with octave 5 starting at the next C. (Thus B4 is a semitone below C5.) 
Note that there is a subtle difference between the languages of psychology and music theory: psycholo-
gists say that the pitches D3 and D4 possess the same chroma (“D-ishness”), while music theorists say that 
the pitches belong to the same category (“the pitch class D”). The difference is analogous to the contrast 
between whiteness (a property) and the collection of all white things (a group). Points in pitch-class space 
can be taken to represent either of these.
