1 Transposition preserves these distances, since f/g = cf/cg. McDermott and Hauser (2005) suggest that 
this measure of musical distance is innate and that it is common to at least some nonhuman animals. 
Dowling and Harwood (1986) suggest it is a musical universal.

1/t, where t is the duration of the cycle.

can be determined by counting keys on an ordinary piano, so that the Cs above mid-
dle C is 61, the D above that is 62, and so on. Since the space is continuous, we can 
use fractional numbers, labeling the pitch 17 hundredths of a semitone (or cents) 
above middle C as 60.17. In principle, we could eschew letter-names for the remain-
der of this book, conducting the discussion entirely in numerical terms. For clarity, 
however, I will use familiar letter names whenever possible. These should be taken as 
shorthand for numerical pitch labels: “Cs4” and “61,” like “Bob Dylan” and “Robert 
Zimmerman,” are different ways of referring to the same thing.
