It has been stated that homophonic music can be\ncalled the style of \u2018developing variation\u2019. Ex. 618 is a very clear illustration. The ana-\nlysis shows that all the motive-forms and phrases of this melody develop gradually\nout of the first three notes, or perhaps even out of the first two notes.\n\nEx. 61d would be eight measures were it not for the insertion of the motive-form \u201cb\u2019\nand its repetition \u2018b,\u2019 (m. 3). The refrain-like recurrence of the opening phrase in\nm. 8-9 is remarkable.\n\nAll these more complicated structures can be related to the practice form by generaliz-\ning the concept on which the practice form was based. The tonic- and dominant-forms\n(or any comparable twofold statement, even if incomplete) may be considered as the\nestablishment of an idea and of a tonality; thus, the foundation is laid for drawing\ninferences. In higher art forms, after such an adequate establishment, remotely\nvaried motive-forms may appear at once, without endangering comprehensibility.\nThe appropriate treatment of the remote motive-forms, through varied or sequential\nrepetitions, then justifies irregularity in length, and unusual harmonization.\n\nApplying this generalization to Ex. 57a, it becomes apparent that after a twofold\nstatement of a basic phrase, such remote derivatives can be used as appear in m. 5-6.\nOn the other hand, the analysis shows the motival connexion. The extension is pro-\nduced by the sequence in m. 6.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE THEMES (4) 63\nSENTENCES\nEx.52 pad 4\na) Op.2f-1 @ co ai \u2014\n\n~ tonic form\n\nb) Op. 2/3-1\ntonic form sa dominant farm a2\n\ncondensed residues\n2\n\n\u00a2) Op.10/1-1\nf tonic form\n\nresidues in scale form\n\n",
