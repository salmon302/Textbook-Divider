The most important single factor is CONTRAST with the principal group: a\ndifferent key or region, contrasting motive-forms, distinct rhythmic characteristics\nand different types of thematic construction and articulation. There are nearly always\nenough differentiated ideas here to justify the term \u2018group\u2019.\n\nSome, at least, of the following features can be expected:\n\nLOOSE STRUCTURE: direct and immediate repetition of segments, juxtaposition of\ncontrasting segments, often with an overlap; little or no recurrence of earlier features\nwithin the section.\n\nSPINNING OUT: derivation of succeeding motive-forms from preceding ones, leading\nto sequences, condensation and liquidation. Chain-like interconnexion.\n\nEVASION OF DEFINITE CADENCES until the end of the whole exposition. This device\ncontributes to the harmonic momentum, and helps to join remotely related motive\nmaterial. Incidental modulation may derive from this technique, without disturbing\nthe essential stability.\n\nCODETTAS, or even a definite CLOSING THEME, at the end of the group, marking the\nend of the exposition.\n\nKEY RELATIONSHIPS are substantially the same as in contrasting middle sections for\nthe simpler forms. When the principal theme is MAJor, the subordinate group nearly\nalways lies in the key of V. Sometimes the interchangeability of parallel major and\nminor permits the appearance of part or all of the subordinate group in the key of\nv (minor), with the exception of codettas (e.g. Op. 2/2-I, Op. 2/3-I).\n\nIn minor, the preferred keys are III (relative major) and v (minor). Since a theme\nwhich first appears in a major key does not always work satisfactorily in minor, and\nsince the minor-major contrast between principal and subordinate themes may be\nessential, considerable modification of the subordinate group may appear in the re-\ncapitulation (e.g. Op. 10/1-I, Op. 13-1).\n\nOf course, departures from these relationships can be found, particularly in com-\nposers after Beethoven. A striking example is to be found in Brahms\u2019s Piano Quintet,\nOp. 34, in f. The chief subordinate theme is in c# and recurs in the recapitulation in\nft. But such relationships are infrequent; and they always require masterly adapta-\ntions of the form and the material.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 7-I. This extensive subordinate group contains six distinct sections. The first,\nemphasizing the dominant of Bb (V), consists of nine measures (m. 41-49). After a\ntwo-measure (overlapping) connective, a varied repetition follows (m. 50-59). A con-\ntrasting more lyrical theme of eight measures (m. 60-67) is repeated with an orna-\n\nTHE SONATA-ALLEGRO 205\n\nmental variation (m. 68) and extended to fourteen measures. A sudden harmonic\ndiversion after the dominant pedal point introduces a surprising major 6/4 chord of\nC. A third idea evolves over a pedal point on G; a momentary cadence to C in the\neighth measure is extended to return to Bp in m. 93. Here an overlapping fourth theme\nappears in octaves; it is repeated in m. 101, the incidental sixteenth-notes of m. 97\nnow overrunning the entire statement. A long tonic pedal point underlies the fifth\nsection (m. 111-27). A striking syncopation contrasts with the liquid sixteenths to\nintroduce the codetta (m. 127-36). From m. 82 to the end each cadence overlaps the\nbeginning of the ensuing section, thus intimately linking the contrasting formulations\nand maintaining momentum.\n\nOp. 10/1-I. The subordinate group begins (m. 56) with a lyrical phrase of four\nmeasures which is immediately repeated, the relation being similar to the tonic form\u2014\ndominant form of the sentence. Two more four-measure phrases follow, forming a\nvaried repetition, in which the broken chords of m. 56-57 and 60-61 are replaced with\nlong scale lines (m. 64-65 and 68-69). A cadential extension is also repeated with\nvariation, reaching the 6/4 in m. 86. An added segment (derived from m. 1) again\nreaches the 6/4 in m. 90, and finally cadences to Ep in m. 94. The entire section from\nm. 72 to m. 94 is a series of approaches to the cadence. The codettas (m. 95~105) are\nderived from the end of the transition.\n\nOp. 10/3-I. The subordinate group, after a principal theme which is short (twenty-\ntwo measures) and simply constructed, comprises 102 measures! The role of the sec-\ntion from m. 23 to m, 53 is somewhat ambiguous. It begins with a clearly formulated\nperiod of eight measures in the key of the relative minor (5). The next segment (m. 31)\nmakes the impression of the middle section of a small ternary form. But a sequential\nmodulation leads to A and an extended cadential process using liquidating devices\ndefinitely establishes that key in m. 53. Is this section merely a transition? Or is it the\nfirst subordinate theme, stated somewhat exceptionally in the key of vi?\n\nAnother theme appears in m. 54, whose structure resembles that of a codetta.\nCould this be the principal subordinate theme? After a repetition referred to the\nparallel minor (m. 61-66), another distinct formulation carried out an extensive\nmodulation (much more elaborate than the alleged transition of m. 23-53), returning\nto A in m. 93. Three contrasted codettas follow (m. 94-105, 106-13 and 114-24),\nthe last of which is transformed into a retransition.\n\nOp. 28-I presents similar problems. The principal theme comprises thirty-nine\nmeasures, the subordinate group 124.\n\nIt is evident that the character, construction, complexity and length of the sub-\nordinate group are determined only by the demands of the individual composition.\nContrasting but related key, character and thematic material are essential. Sufficient\nclosing or codetta material to mark the end of the exposition clearly is the usual\npractice, though a kind of retransition sometimes masks the definite formal sub-\n\n",
