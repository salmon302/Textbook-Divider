The ending\non | preceded by V is so useful that it is often applied when, for example, tonic form is\n1-H, I-VI or even I-TIT.\n\nlilusirations from the literature\n\nIn Exs. 35a, 6 and 536, the first phrase employs only I and the second phrase\nonly V.\n\nThe scheme I -V (tonic form), V-I (dominant form) can be observed in Exs. 526\nand c. Compare also, among Beethoven's works, the Piano Sonata, Op. 31/2-IT (four-\nmeasure phrases); and the String Quartets, Op. 59/2-IIf and Op. I31-1V. The melody\nis modified only enough to conform with the harmony.\n\nThe tonic form of Ex. 36 is based on I-V-I; the dominant form on V-I-V. In Ex. 37\nthe dominant form includes some passing harmonies. In contrast, the passing har-\nmonies in the tonic form of Ex. 38 are not mechanically preserved in the dominant\nform. But in Ex. 39, where the tonic form consists of I-IV, the dominant form consists\nbasically of V-J, though more elaborate part-writing disguises it.\n\nCOMMENT ON EXAMPLES\n\nThe tonic form (m. 1-2) of Ex. 40a is followed (m. 3-4) by a dominant form in\nwhich the melody follows the contour of the first phrase exactly. In Exs. 405 and c\nother dominant forms are shown in which, while the rhythm is preserved, the contour\nis treated more freely.\n\nIn Ex. 41 the dominant forms are varied more than the harmonic change requires.\nIn Exs. 415 and c the tonic form is based on four harmonies, which makes a true\nanswer difficult, To answer literally a tonic form with too many harmonies is im-\npracticable. Here, only the main harmonies, I-V, could be answered, with V-I.\n\nIt should be observed that even in these short passages, a definite and regular\naccompaniment is employed to animate the harmony and to express a specific charac-\nter. Consistency in the application of accompanimental characteristics is a powerful\nunifying factor.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE THEMES (1) 23\nEx. 35\na) Op. 2/1-T ~~ i i\n\nEx. 36\n\nEx.37\n\nEx.38\nMozart, String Quartet, (K.V. 464-1\n\nEx.39\n\n",
