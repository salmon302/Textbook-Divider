On the contrary, it is precisely the character which contributes variety.\nEvery composer, in sketching motives for variation, will consider the necessity of\nproviding sufficient contrast of character.\n\nSuch contrasts are especially necessary if the piece, in traditional fashion. offers no\ngreater key contrast between variations than tonic major\u2014tonic minor (naggiore \u2014\nminore). The Six Variations, Op. 34, of Beethoven present a unique deviation from this\nprincipic. While the theme is in F, the variations are in D, Bb, G, Eb, c, F. There are\nalso great differences of tempo and character. The theme and first variation are\nadagio; the second, \u2018allegro ma non troppo\u2019; the third, allegretto; the fourth. \u2018tempo\ndi Menuetto\u2019; the fifth, \u2018Marcia: allegretto\u2019; the sixth, allegretto; followed by a coda\nsection which returns to the adagio of the beginning. The contrast of character is\nfurther enhanced by altering the metre: 2/4, 2/4, 6/8, 4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 6/8, 2/4,\n\nFrom the standpoint of aesthetics, there is no reason why the whole set should be\nrestricted to one tonic. The symphony and the sonata long ago outgrew this restriction.\n\nBrahms increases variety by intermingling lyric variations with the more rhythmic\nones. In the Handel Variations one might tentatively characterize some of the varia-\ntions as: lyric or cantabile (5, 6 and 11); impassioned (9 and 20); rhythmic (7 and 8);\nHungarian (13); musette-like (22). Note the suggestive interpretive indications: legato,\nstaccato, risoluto, dolce, energico, grazioso, leggiero.\n\nThe most important principle of organization is variety. This does not preclude\ngrouping two or three variations, without considerable change of character, especially\nif an idea is elaborated in several steps. Since Beethoven, the general tendency has been\nto build up toward a climax (in very long sets, a series of climaxes), which may be\nemotional, rhythmic, dynamic, velocitative or any combination of these.\n\nOccasionally a short bridge or transition is inserted between variations (e.g. Six\nVariations, Op. 34, Variations 5-6). Generally, also, a coda or finale is added, which is\nsometimes an outgrowth of the last variation. Detailed discussion of techniques for\nsuch passages will be reserved for Chapter XVIII.\n\nTHEME AND VARIATIONS 175\n\nEx. 124 VARIATIONS\na) Beethoven, Diabelli Variations, Op.120\n\nEx.125\nBeethaven, 12 Variations in C-minor\na) Var.4\n\n-\u2014- = ~ +--+ - ee ee ee eee eee ee ee\n",
