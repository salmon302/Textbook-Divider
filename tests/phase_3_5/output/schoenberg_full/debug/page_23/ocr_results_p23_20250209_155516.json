ANTECEDENT OF THE PERIOD\n\nONLY a small percentage of all classical themes can be classified as periods. Romantic\ncomposers make still Jess use of them. However, the practise of writing periods is a\nconvenient way to become acquainted with many technical problems.\n\nThe construction of the beginning determines the construction of the continuation,\nThe period differs from the sentence in postponement of the repetition. The first\nphrase is not repeated immediately, but united with more remote (contrasting)\nmotive-forms, to constitute the first half of the period, the antecedent. After this con-\ntrast repetition cannot be longer postponed without endangering comprehensibility.\nThus the second half, the consequent, is constructed as a kind of repetition of the\nantecedent.\n\nIn composing periods a practice form will be useful. It should consist of eight mea-\nsures, divided into an antecedent and consequent of four measures each by a caesura\nin the fourth measure. This caesura, a type of musical punctuation comparable to a\ncomma or semicolon, is carried out in both melody and harmony,\n\nIn a great majority of cases the antecedent ends on V, usually approached through\na half or full cadence, but sometimes through mere interchange of I and V. Ante-\ncedents which end on J also exist.\n\nThe consequent usually ends on I, V or III (major or minor) with a full cadence.\nAlthough the consequent should be in part a repetition of the antecedent, the cadence,\nat least, will have to be different, even if it leads to the same degree. Generally, one or\ntwo measures of the beginning will be retained, sometimes with more or less variation.\n\nANALYSIS OF PERIODS FROM BEETHOVEN\u2019S PIANO SONATAS\n\nOp. 2/1-H, Adagio. The antecedent ends on V (m. 4); the consequent on I (m. 8).\nThe harmony of the antecedent is a mere interchange of I and V; the consequent ends\n\n' The real purpose of musical construction is not beauty, but intelligibility, Former theorists and aestheti-\ncans called such forms as the period symmetrical. The term symmetry has probably been applied to music\nby analogy to the forms of the graphic arts and architecture, But the only really symmetrical forms in music\nare the mirror forms, derived from contrapuntal music. Reat symmetry is not a principle of musical construc-\nhon. Even if the consequent in a period repeats the antecedent strictly, the structure can only be called \"quasi-\nsymmetrical\u2019, Though quasi-symmetrical construction is used extensively in popular music, that beauty can\nexist without symmetry is proved by a great many cases of asymmetrical construction.\n\n",
