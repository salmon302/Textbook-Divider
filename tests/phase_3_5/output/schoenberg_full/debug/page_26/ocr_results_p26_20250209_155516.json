Sec also Exs. 44b,\nm. 7; 44/, m. 7; 47c, m. 6-7; 49a, m. 7.\n\nAn unusual example of rhythmic decrease is shown in Ex. 464, m. 7. Other examples\ninclude Exs. 447 and 46i (very conspicuous). The two cases in Exs. 44/ and 47a are\nremarkable because, instead of a rhythmic decrease, a \u2018written-out ritardando\u2019 appears\nas an extension.\n\nThe melody in the cadence commonly reduces characteristic features (which de-\nmand continuation) to uncharacteristic ones. Illustrations of this can be found in a\ngreat many examples. Compare, for instance, m. 7 of Exs. 45c and f with their respec-\ntive m. {-2. In both cases the characteristic intervals are abandoned, or combined\nin a different order, and in Ex. 45c the eighth-note movement stops entirely with the\nthird and fourth beats.\n\nIf there is a climax the melody is likely to recede from it, balancing the compass by\nreturning to the middle register. This decline in the cadence contour, combined with\nconcentration of the harmony and the liquidation of motival obligations, can be\ndepended upon to provide effective delimitation of the structure. See, for example,\nExs. 45f g.\n\nRHYTHMIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\nSince the consequent is a varied repetition of the antecedent, and since variation\ndoes not change all the features but preserves some of them, distantly related motive-\nforms might sound incoherent.\n\nTHE PRESERVATION OF THE RHYTHM ALLOWS EXTENSIVE CHANGES IN THE MELODIC\nCONTOUR.\n\nThus in Ex. 476 the consequent preserves only one rhythm, abandoning for the\nsake of unity even the slight variations in m. 2 and 4. This rhythmic unification per-\nmits far-reaching changes of the melodic contour in slow tempo, and promotes\ncomprehensibility in rapid tempo. See also Exs. 45a, f, 46d, j.\n\nCOMMENT ON PERIODS BY ROMANTIC COMPOSERS\n\nSome of the classical examples of Exs. 44-47 deviate from the eight-measure con-\nstruction. Such deviations can also be found among the examples from Mendelssohn\n(Ex. 48) and Brahms (Ex. 51). To control such divergencies requires special tech-\nniques of extension, reduction, etc., whose discussion must be postponed.\n\nThese examples show the various manners in which Romantic composers approach\nthematic construction. The examples from Brahms are especially interesting because\nof their harmony. They differ from the classic examples in a more prolific exploitation\nof the multiple meaning of harmonies. Ex. 5lq is an illustration. In m. 1-6 there\nappear only a few harmonies belonging diatonically to /-minor; but most of them\n(at *) could be understood as Neapolitan 6\" of \u00a2-minor, an explanation supported by\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE THEMES (3) 31\n\nthe immediate continuation. The deviation in m. 3 toward Eb is surprising. While \u00a35\nmight be the dominant of the mediant region (relative major), it is actually treated\nlike a tonic on VI. But in m. 7-8 Brahms finally identifies m. 1-2 and 5-6 as pertain-\ning to c-minor, or, more accurately, to the v-region of /-minor.!\n\nIn Ex. Stca repetition (m. 17-32), unchanged in melody and harmony, is varied by\nsupplying a quasi-contrapuntal treatment of the accompanying lower voiccs.\n\nThe construction of Exs. 51d and e will be clarified later (Chapter XV). Observe\nthe use of a pedal point in Ex. 51d, at the beginning (m. 1-2) and at the end (m. 10-14).\n\nThough the pedal point is often used in masterpieces for expressive or pictorial\npurposes, its real meaning should be a constructive one. In this sense one finds it at\nthe end of a transition or an elaboration, emphasizing the end of a previous modula-\ntion and preparing for the reintroduction of the tonic. In such cases the effect of\na pedal point should be one of retardation: it holds back the forward progress of the\nharmony. Another constructive use of such retardation of the harmonic movement\n1, to balance remote motival variation (a method paralleled by the balancing of centri-\nfugal harmony with simpler motival variation). If no such purpose is involved, a pedal\npoint should be avoided. A moving, melodic bass line is always a greater merit.\n\nIn Ex. 5Uf the tendency of the smallest notes accounts for a variant in m. 5. The\nrhythmic figure \u2018a\u2019 is shifted from the second beat to the first beat. In consequence,\nan almost continuous flow of eighth-notes prevails.\n\n? The rapid development of harmony since the beginning of the nineteenth century has been the great\nobstacte tu the acceptance of every new composer from Schubert on, Frequent deviation from the tonic\ntcgion into more or less foreign regions seemed to obstruct unity and intelligibility. However, the most\nadvanced mind is still subject to human limitations. Thus composers of this style, instinctively feeling the\ndanger of incoherence, counteracted the tension in one plune (the complex harmony) by simplification in\nanother plane (the motival and rhythmic construction), This perhaps also explains the unvaried repetitions\n\nand frequent sequences of Wagner, Bruckner, Debussy, C\u00e9sar Franck, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius and many\nothers,\n\n\u2018To the contemporaries of Gustav Mahler, Max Reger, Richard Strauss, Maurice Ravel, etc., far-reaching\nhurmony no longer seriously endangered comprehensibility, and today\u2014even popular composers make it\nliving from it!\n\n",
