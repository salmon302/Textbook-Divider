Earlier composers sometimes introduce, in the pre-\nceding retransition, anticipatory quotations of the material of a return theme\n(Mozart, Symphony in g minor, K.V. 550-I, m. 139-64; Beethoven String Quartet, Op.\n18/6-IV, m. 105-15). These may give the impression of a recapitulation \u2018in the wrong\nkey\u2019, broken off to make way for the real recapitulation.\n\nBrahms goes further. In this movement, the principal theme is an A\u2014B-a! form. In\nthe recapitulation (m. 194), the beginning reappears in the key of F#, a half step lower\nthan the original G. The continuation is subtly modified to return through a chromatic\nthird relation from the dominant of the relative minor to the original level in m. 207.\nIn compensation for this remarkable change of region, the recapitulation remains\nclose to the original version in other respects.\n\nCHANGES AND ADAPTATIONS IN THE RECAPITULATION\n(SUBORDINATE GROUP)\n\nSince the subordinate group is repeated only once, after a number of intervening\ncontrasts, variation is not strictly necessary. In fact, too much variation, especially at\nthe beginning of the subordinate theme, could easily prevent recognition. But in order\nto repeat the subordinate material in the tonic region the transition requires changes.\n\nAt an appropriate point the transition turns toward a different region, often the\nsubdominant (major or minor), and continues indirectly to the upbeat chord, usually\nby means of sectional transpositions of the original material. In the simpler cases\nthere are no further changes and the ensuing material is merely transposed to the\ntonic region, perhaps with minor ornamental variations.\n\nIn more complex examples there may be omissions, additions or complete recon-\nstruction, though the more elaborate changes are not common in rondos.\n\nIHustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/2-IV. The transition, which originally led to I of E, is repeated unchanged\nexcept for a two-measure reduction in length and minor modification of the last\nmeasure. But the significance of the E chord becomes that of V in A (m. 123). The\nthythm of the subordinate theme is modified so that the group of four descending\neighth-notes comes at the end of the measure instead of at the beginning. This theme,\nalso, is shortened slightly.\n\nOp. 7-IV. The entire subordinate group is recapitulated without major changes,\nexcept for the necessary redirection of the transition in m. 113. The syncopated\nliquidating variation in m. 147 is interesting.\n\nOp. 22-1V. The only significant change is in the transition, which starts exactly as\n\n\" - * 7 \u00a5 FSP rt Fe Pee\n\nTHE RONDO FORMS 195\n\nin its first appearance. In the fifth and sixth measures (m. 134-5) an added sequence-\nlike repetition of the two preceding measures changes the course of the modulation.\n\nOp. 10/3-IV. The transition is modified in m. 67-68 and somewhat extended. But\nthe theme which originally appeared in m. 17 is omitted entirely. In its place appears\na modulatory section built on the basic motive.\n\nBeethoven, String Quartet, Op. 18/6-IV. Here the transition (m. 61-76) undergoes\nmodification from the very beginning of its reappearance in the recapitulation. The\naddition of accidentals in the first four measures (m. 132) prepares for transposition\nof the continuation up a third (instead of up the expected fourth). Only in m. 145,\nwhere two measures are added, is the shift made to lead to the dominant. The many\nother interesting features of this rondo (especially the treatment of the rctransition,\nwhich anticipates the main theme over a pedal point) cannot be discussed at this\npoint.\n\nOp. 13-II]. Treatment of the subordinate group in minor is more complicated,\nespecially when the subordinate theme is in major. To repeat it in minor would change\nits character and diminish the contrast. Therefore, it usually recurs in tonic major\nand at some later point turns to the minor. But far-reaching changes often accompany\nsuch treatment.\n\nHere the original transition (m. 18-24) completely disappears. Instead, the second\nhalf of the theme provides motive-forms for a new transitional segment (m. 129-34).\nThe ensuing material, while retaining the original motive-forms intact, is reconstructed\nquite freely. Only a hint of c minor is heard (m. 159) in the much extended closing\nsection (m. 154-70), which displaces entirely the original retransitional segment\n(m. 51-61).\n\nBeethoven, String Quartet, Op. 18/4-IV. The original p-section (m. 17~40) is a small\nternary form with internal repetitions. In the recapitulation an added bridge (m. 111-\n16) introduces a reconstructed B-section in the parallel major. The ternary organiza-\ntion disappears; after a statement and repetition of its opening the thematic material\nis liquidated and a long retransition using motive-forms of the principal theme\nappears (m. 137-62). The exposition contained sufficient contrast of tonality without\ntransitions, But in the recapitulation these modulatory passages become essential to\nrelieve the uninterrupted emphasis of the tonic (minor and major).\n\nTHE LARGE RONDO FORMS (ABA-C-ABA)\n\nThe large rondo forms generally express the character of the dance-song. The rate\nof movement is moderate or rapid, and the mood cheerful, playful or brilliant. The\nclassical composers frequently used these forms as final movements in cyclic works\n(sonata, string quartet or symphony).\n\nOccasionally the middle section (c) is comparable in size and structure to the\nB-section, providing an undifferentiated ABACABA (Beethoven, String Quartet, Op.\n",
