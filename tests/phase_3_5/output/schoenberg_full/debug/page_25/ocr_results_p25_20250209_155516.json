One of the\nfeatures, often the upbeat or a preceding motive-form, is used to join them. (Exs.\n44d, 1, 45c, d, g, 46e, 47d). But abrupt juxtaposition of contrasting forms need not\nnecessarily produce imbalance (Ex. 45a).\n\nAs harmonic basis for an antecedent, one can use progressions like those of Exs. 43\nto 51. Movement of the harmony in equal notes (i.e. regular change of the harmony)\nsupports unity because it is a primitive kind of \u2018motive of the accompaniment\u2019.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that one purpose of constructing motive-forms from a\nbroken chord (Exs. 5-11, 17-29) was to assure a sound relationship between melody\nand harmony. To make many sketches of motive-forms, built from broken chords by\nvariation, remains a valuable method of deriving well co-ordinated materials.\n\nOne may acquiesce to the \u2018tendency of the smallest notes\u2019. But too many small notes\nmay produce a crowded effect. On the other hand, in masterpieces one meets cases like\nthe extreme rhythmical contrast between first and second phrases in Exs. 45a and d.\nIn other Mozart examples (Exs. 45d, g), the co-ordination of the small notes with the\nharmony, as ancillary notes, is of a perfection which no beginner dare hope for.\n\nContinuous and thorough study of examples from musical literature is essential.\n\nThere are many melodies whose compass is very small (sce Exs. 45/, 50a, 6). Some-\ntimes when the antecedent remains within a fifth (Ex. 47e) or a sixth (Ex. 46d) the\nconsequent ascends to a climax. But melodies whose compass at the beginning is very\nbroad (Exs. 44a, \u00a2, d, 45a) are likely to achieve balance by returning to a middle\nregister. All these examples show that much variety can be achieved within a relatively\nsmall compass, though the extension of the compass is often a defence against\nmonotony.\n\nEnvisioning a definite character helps to stimulate inventiveness. The accompani-\nment makes important contributions to the expression of character. Such features as\ndifferentiation between detached and legato notes (Exs. 44d, 47c, 48a, 50a, \u00a2); rests\nwhere harmonization is not required (Exs. 35, 38, 444, 466); unharmonized upbeats\n(Exs. 44a, g, 45f, 46b, d, etc.); semicontrapuntal treatment of middle voices (Exs.\n4b, 44g, 45a, 485, 5If); afterbeat harmony (Exs. 44c, d, 45d, 46d, 50e); and special\nrhythmic figures (Exs. 46/, 47, 49a, 50a, SIf) should be employed from the very\nbeginning.\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile a complex accompaniment with good piano style. Writing\nfor the piano should ignore, as much as possible, the existence of the pedal, i.e. every-\nthing should be within easy reach of the fingers.\n\nOne must beware of (1) imbalance through overcrowding, (2) destruction of the\ncharacter and (3) obscuration of the harmonic progression. Fluent part-writing in\nthe accompaniment does not endanger the clarity of the harmony. But control of\nthe root progressions is essential.\n\nVII\nCONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE THEMES\n\n3. CONSEQUENT OF THE PERIOD\n\n!tHHE consequent is a modified repetition of the antecedent, made necessary by the\nremote motive-forms in m. 3--4. If the period is a complete piece (e.g. children\u2019s songs)\nit must end (usually with a perfect authentic cadence) on I. If it is part of a larger form\nit may end on I, V or HI (major or minor).!\n\nAn unchanged and complete repetition is very rare. Even in the very simple cases\nof Exs. 508, c and e, at least the last measure is modified. Usually, the introduction of\na full cadence requires earlier changes. In Exs. 45/, k, 46a, g and 50a the deviation of\nthe harmony occurs in the seventh measure; and in Exs. 44/ and 47c, \u00a2, in the sixth\nmeasure,\n\nVariation of the harmony can start as early as the first measure of the consequent.\nIn Ex. 45f the variation consists in the use of inversions of the same harmonies. The\nconsequent may even begin on a different degree. For instance, in the Menuetto of\nBeethoven's Op. 10/3, m. 9, it starts on I], as a sequence of the antecedent. In Exs.\n44b and 46d, it begins on V. The harmonic variation in m. 5 of Ex. 47d is the begin-\nning of an enriched cadence.\n\nMELODIC CONSIDERATIONS: CADENCE CONTOUR\n\nVariety needs no justification, It is a merit in itself. But some variations in the\nmelody are involuntary results of the changed harmonic construction, particularly of\nthe cadence.\n\nIn order to exercise the function of a cadence, the melody must assume certain\ncharacteristics, producing a special cadence contour, which usually contrasts with\nwhat precedes it. The melody parallels the changes in the harmony, obeying the ten-\ndency of the smallest notes (like an accelerando), or, on the contrary, contradicting\nihe tendency by employing longer notes (like a ritardando).\n\nIncrease of smaller note values is more frequent in cadences than decrease. As\nexamples of rhythmic increase, sce, in the Beethoven Sonatas: Op. 2/1, Adagio, m.\n\n' Sometimes major HWE occurs in a major key. In Becthoven\u2019s String Quartet, Op. 131-V, a (Phrygian)\ntoulf cadence leads to a (major) UL. In his String Quartet, Op. 18/5, Variation 4, a full cadence leads to a\n\n(uunor) iinin im, 8 Ending on minor vy, in a minor key, is illustrated in Ex. 464. In two extraordinary cases\n(the String Quartets, Op. 59/2-IE and Op, 132-\u00a5V), Becthoven even makes use of VII (dominant of relat ve\nn..yor) in minor.\n\n",
