One single tone is\nnot problematic because the ear defines it as a tonic, a point of repose. Every added\ntone makes this determination questionable. Every musical form can be considered\nas an attempt to treat this unrest either by halting or limiting it, or by solving the\nproblem. A melody re-establishes repose through balance. A theme solves the prob-\nlem by carrying out its consequences. The unrest in a melody need not reach below\nthe surface, while the problem of a theme may penetrate to the profoundest depths.\n\nSince rhythmic characteristics are less decisive in a melody, it could be called two-\ndimensional, comprising chiefly interval and latent harmony. On the other hand, the\nimportance of rhythmic development makes the problem of the theme three-dimen-\nsional. (See, for example, Beethoven, Op. 10/I-I, Op. 27/2-11], Op. 14/2-I, Exs.\n95a, b.)\n\nThus a melody can be compared to an \u2018apercu\u2019, an \u2018aphorism\u2019, in its rapid advance\nfrom problem to solution. But a theme resembles rather a scientific hypothesis which\ndoes not convince without a number of tests, without presentation of proof.\n\nThe melody also tends to achieve balance in the most direct way. It avoids intensify-\ning the unrest; it supports comprehensibility by limitation, and facilitates lucidity\nthrough subdivision; it extends itself rather by continuation than by elaboration or\ndevelopment. It uses slightly varied motive-forms, which achieve variety by presenting\nthe basic features in different situations. It remains within the closer harmonic\nrelationships.\n\nAll these restrictions and limitations produce that independence and self-determina-\ntion because of which a melody requires no addition, continuation or elaboration.\n\nIn contrast, a state of repose will scarcely be reached or attempted early in a theme;\nit will generally sharpen its problem (bringing it to a point) or deepen it. (Beethoven,\nOp. 53-I, Op. 57-1, Op. 31/1-I, Op. 31/2-1.)\n\nSubdivision, often similar to that of a melody, may occur in a theme (Op. 90-1,\nOp. 2/2-1). In a melody the separation is seldom definite, so as to offer an opening for,\nor a bridge to, a continuation. In themes remotely coherent segments are often\njuxtaposed in a co-ordinate meaning, without connectives (Op. 90-1, Op. 14/2-D.\nSeldom is a theme extended by spinning a continuation for mere formal balance;\nrather, it leaps directly to remote developments of the basic motive (Op. 10/1-I, m.\n9, 17; Op. 7-1; Op. 31/2-1; Ex. 95c).\n\nThe formulation of a theme assumes that there will follow \u2018adventures\u2019, \u2018predica-\nments\u2019, which ask for solution, for elaboration, for development, for contrast (the\nimplications are discussed more fully in Chapter XX). The harmony of a theme is often\n\nweer <\n\nor eae\n\nMELODY AND THEME 103\n\nactive, \u2018roving\u2019, unstable. Nevertheless, and in spite of remote harmonies, one will\nfind that even complex themes still move around a tonic, or a definite contrasting\nregion (Brahms, First Symphony-I, Piano Quartet, Op. 60-I; Beethoven, Op. 53-1).\nThe organization cannot be so loose that one might feel a lack of structure.\n\nA theme is not at all independent and self-determined. On the contrary, it is strictly\nbound to consequences which have to be drawn, and without which it may appear\ninsignificant.\n\nA melody, classic or contemporary, tends toward regularity, simple repetitions and\neven symmetry. Hence, it generally reveals distinct phrasing. Of course, the length\nof a singer's breath is no measure for the length of a phrase in an instrumental\nmelody, but the number of measures in moderate tempo is likely to be about the same\nas in a vocal melody.\n\nTheory must be stricter than reality. It is forced to generalize, and that means re-\nduction on the one hand, exaggeration on the other. This description necessarily\nexaggerates the difference between melody and theme. Hybrid forms exist. Sometimes\na melody elaborates its rhythmical prablems, or implies remote harmonies, or is\nstructurally complicated, or draws consequences, or is followed by development. On\nthe other hand, many a theme contains melodic segments, or is based on the simple\nconstruction of the period, or is treated as if it were independent.\n\nAll the previous statements are of limited or relative validity. Time has not only\nproduced a development of the technical means, and widened the concept of theme\nand melody in creative minds; it has also changed our comprehension of music written\nin preceding epochs. In consequence of this development, nobody today would\nhesitate to consider the two themes from Beethoven's string quartets in Exs. 96a and b\nas melodies, although they are structurally instrumental themes. This impression is\nperhaps supported by the phrasing, which is that of a melody. But Ex. 96c could never\nhave failed to make the impression of a melody, although there is only a single symp-\ntom\u2014singableness. All the other symptoms are missing\u2014no section or phrase is\nrepeated; there ts no distinct motive or motive-form; and the segments, m. 17-22,\n25-27 and 29-30 develop a figure (which previously appeared in the viola, m. 13) in\na manner which is usual in a theme rather than a melody.\n\nExs. 97, 98, 99 and 100 show the tonal contour of a number of melodies. It was\nmentioned previously that melodies proceed in waves, a fact which can readily be\nobserved here. The amplitude of these waves varies. A melody seldom moves long in\none direction. Though the student was advised to avoid repeating the culmination\npoint, the climax, the graphs show that many a good melody does so. The student had\nbetter not attempt it.\n\nIn the music of our predecessors, somewhat modified instrumental melodies\n(especially in operas and oratorios) were often used also for the singers. In those days\nthe difference between vocal and instrumental melodies was not very great. It is\n\n",
