These are aBA forms, in which the parts themselves may be\naba forms. A similarity to the larger rondos can be seen in Beethoven's Fourth and\nSeventh Symphonies, where a double repetition of the scherzo produces an ABABA\nform. Schumann, by adding a second trio (in, for instance, the Scherzos of the First\nand Second Symphonies, the String Quartet in a, and the Piano Quintet), produces\nthe form ABACA.\n\nIllustrations of the following types of organization can be found in the literature:\n\nThe Andante forms (ABA and ABaB).\"\n\nThe smaller Rondo forms (ABABA and ABACA).\n\nThe large Rondo form (aABA\u2014C--aBA), which includes a Trio (C).\n\nThe Sonata Rondo? (ABaA\u2014c!\u2014aBa), with Durchfiihrung (C').\n\nThe Great Sonata Rondo (aBA-CC!-ABA), containing both Trio and Durchftihrung.\n\nThe structural elements of these forms can be simple and short, or compound and\nlong. There are transitions, codettas, episodes, etc., as described in the preceding\nchapter. Each of the larger parts may consist of several segments. The classification\nof the form is based on the number and position of the parts, not on the actual length\nof the piece.\n\nRepetitions of the a-section are almost exclusively in the tonic region; they may be\nconsiderably varied (see p. 193). The B-section, which initially appears in a contrasting\nregion, is transposed, if it recurs in the recapitulation, to the tonic region, with\nappropriate modification of the transition (see p. 194).\n\nTHE ANDANTE FORMS (ABA AND ABAB)\n\nOp. 2/1-HI. (ABAB.) The A-section is a ternary form (m. 1--16). A transition (m. 17-\n22) leads to the first subordinate theme in the dominant (m. 23), followed by a second\nsmall idea (m. 28 with upbeat). The latter part of m. 31 acts as a bridge to the return\nof the a-section (m. 32). The omission of the transition permits the B-section to follow\n\n1 To call these \u2018rondos\u2019 is perhaps an exaggeration. 2 Who introduced this useful term?\n\nia a oe a oo a 2 oe a a eee\n\nTHE RONDO FORMS 191\n\nimmediately (m. 48), transposed to the tonic region. Three codetta-like measures\nbring the movement to a close.\n\nOp. 7-H. (apas.) The a-section is a ternary form (m. 1-24). A small bridging phrase\nconnects to the B-section (m. 25), which starts in the flat submediant (Ab) region and\nmodulates through subdominant minor (f) and Neapolitan (Dp) regions. In m. 37 the\ndominant is reached. But instead of the recapitulation, a dramatic episode intervenes,\nin which there ts a quotation of the main theme (in the remote tonality of Bb, domi-\nnant of the flat mediant, m. 42). The real recapitulation appears in m. 51: the re-\ncapitulation of B, m. 74 is reduced considerably and transposed, suppressing the\nmodulatory tendency, to the tonic. A coda starts in m. 79.\n\nOp. 28-II. (aBA.) Both a and B are ternary forms. The repetitions in the recapitula-\ntion are written out, with typically pianistic elaboration. A short coda quotes the\nleading motives of both a and B.\n\nOp. 31/I-II. (aga.) Although made up of only three sections, this movement is 119\nmeasures long. The A-section is a ternary form (m. 1-16, 17-26, 27-34). The p-section\n(m. 36) begins in flat submediant, and reaches the dominant in m. 53, dwelling on it to\nintroduce the recapitulation in m. 65. A coda begins in m. 99.\n\nOp. 31/2-II. (aBas.) A curious feature in this movement is the consistent use of a\nsingle rhythmic feature in all the transitions and retransitions (see m. 17-30, 38-42,\n59-72, 81 ff.). A short coda derived from the principal theme (m. 90) follows the final\nretransition, which, surprisingly, is twice as long as the first.\n\nMozart, String Quartet in C, K.V. 465--II. (AbaB.) The theme of this Andante has\nlittle resemblance to the previously described practice forms. There is an elaborate\ntransition, m. 13. As in the previous instance, the same motive recurs in all the\ntransitional passages (m. 39, 58) and in the coda (m. 101).\n\nBrahms, String Quartet, Op. 51 /2-II. (aBA.) The main theme is a rather long ternary\nform with codettas, but no transition. Curiously, the recapitulation begins in the flat\nsubmediant region (F) and returns to the tonic only when the a'-section of the small\nternary form is reached. Such apa forms can also be found among Brahms\u2019s piano\npieces, e.g. the Intermezzo, Op. 117/1. The effect is more that of a large ternary form\nthan of a true rondo; only the fact that the main theme is itself a small ternary, and\nthat the a-section of it does in fact recur four times with intervening contrasts permits\ntentative inclusion among the rondos.\n\nHaydn, String Quartet ind, Op. 76/2-II. (aBA.) The B-section is merely a modulatory\ncontrast and does not include a subordinate theme. Among the predecessors of the\nclassical school this embryonic form is frequently found.\n\nThe formal schemes under discussion can be found throughout the literature in all\nkinds of cyclic works: sonatas, trios, quartets and even in symphonies. They are con-\nfined to movements of slow or moderate tempo, in which more complex structures\nwould become excessively long.\n\nFe ee ee evw\n",
