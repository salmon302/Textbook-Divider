The number of parts may be\nincreased by supplying codettas, episodes, etc. In such situations, derivatives of the\nbasic motive are formulated into new thematic units. Their structural function, how-\never, is co-ordinate rather than contrasting.\n\nLarge forms develop through the generating power of contrasts. There are innu-\nmerable kinds of contrast; the larger the piece, the more types of contrast should be\npresent to illuminate the main idea.\n\nIn the simpler forms the chief contrast is furnished by the harmony, organized to\nexpress appropriate related regions. In the scherzo the modulatory is presented in\nopposition to the stable. In larger forms a modulatory passage may be organized into\nan independent section, the TRANSITION, which connects the main theme with another\nstable contrasting idea, the secondary or subordinate theme.\n\nTHE TRANSITION\n\nThe purpose of a transition ts not only to introduce a contrast; it Is, itself, a contrast.\nIt may begin, after the end of the main theme, with new thematic formulations; or the\nend of the main theme may be modified thematically and harmonically into a con-\nnecting segment.\n\nA transition, especially if it is an independent section, belongs to the group of sub-\nsidiary ideas. Transitions appear at various places in larger forms; between principal\nand subordinate themes (modulating to a different region); as retransitions (returning\n\nee 7,2. \u00a5Frrr reer\n\nTHE PARTS OF LARGER FORMS 179\n\nto the tonic); or, in the recapitulation, reformulated as a roundabout way from tonic\nto tonic.\n\nThe structure of a transition ordinarily includes four elements: establishment of the\ntransitional idea (through repetition, often sequential); modulation (often in several\nstages); liquidation of motival characteristics; and establishment of a suitable upbeat\nchord. These aspects may overlap in varying degrees.\n\nTHE TRANSITION WITH AN INDEPENDENT THEME\n\nWhen a special transitional theme follows the main theme, it is customarily differ-\nent in structure from the preceding and following themes. The theme consists of a\nshort segment within which the constituent motive-forms are only slightly varied.\nShort rhythmic figures lend themselves readily and flexibly to the processes of\nmodulation and liquidation. After the initial statement, at least a partial repetition\nestablishes the idea, after which modulation begins. Fluid change of region and prompt\nelimination of characteristic features distinguish the transition from the stable themes\nwhich normally precede and follow it.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/2-I. The transition starts in m. 32, with a segment of four measures, built\nfrom an inversion of m. 9-10 of the main theme. A partial repetition (a third higher)\nmodulates to V of the dominant (m. 42). Over a pedal point the scale line is liquidated\nby interrupting the descent twice. M. 42-57 dwell on the dominant, a fact which\nfacilitates the conversion of E major (m. 39) into \u00a2 minor (m. 58).\n\nOp. 2/2-IV. The initial segment of the transition is built on a cadence (m. 17-20),\nabove which a figure in sixteenths provides the motival content. In the continuation\nonly two measures are repeated (with a slight variation), followed by a turn toward\nthe dominant region, EF (m. 24), the tonic of the following section.\n\nOp. 2/3-I. The initial segment of the transition consists of four measures (m. 13-\n16). Its repetition is modified to end on V (m. 21), around which the harmony dwells\nfor six measures, still without any real modulation (the F# remains merely orna-\nmental). The relation to the following subordinate theme is peculiar (see p. 183).\n\nOp. 10/3-1V. This very short Rondo contains all the normal constituent parts in\nminiature. The transition (m. 9), in spite of an internal repetition, consists of only\nseven measures, and leads merely to a V, without any real modulation.\n\nOp. 7-1V. The transition starts (m. 17) with a motive, in the left hand, which pre-\nviously appeared (m. 9) as the motive of the contrasting middle section of the main\ntheme. It settles down (m. 24) to an interchange of | and V of the dominant region,\nassociated with the usual liquidation. Surprisingly, it ends (m. 36) with an enriched\ncadence (starting in m. 30) to I of the dominant region. The ending on | of the\ndominant region cannot here be convincingly explained as an overlap. It is better\n\n- ee eee eer Ow\n",
