Thus the whole form be-\ncomes a complex ternary structure:\n\nA\u2014\u2014-B\u2014\u2014\u2014--A\nA-B-A\u2014\u2014C-\u2014A-B~A\n\nThe trio section is often itself ternary, and it expresses a definite contrasting key,\nusually somewhat more remote than that of the B-section. For example:\n\nSection A B A c\n\nc (minor)\na\nAb\nEb\nE\ne\nAb\n\u00a2 (minor) Eb c G\n&\n\nThe character of the c-section contrasts with both the a- and B-sections. Quite often\nit is \u2018\u00e9tude-like\u2019; not infrequently it is \u2018contrapuntal\u2019 in the sense that the motive or\ntheme undergoes little internal variation, but instead is placed in various combinations\nwith itself and other material.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/2-IV. The a-section is a small ternary form (m. 1-16). A transition (m. 17-\n26) leads to the B-section in the dominant region. This typical, loosely constructed\nsubordinate idea is connected to the repetition of a by a two-measure bridge (m. 39-\n40). The trio (m. 57-99) is an \u00e9tude-like ternary structure lying in the tonic minor\nregion, with internal repetitions like those to be found in the minuet. The final\nrepetition of the beginning of the trio (m. 88) changes into a retransition. The modi-\nfications in the recapitulation are largely ornamental. The final repetition of the A-sec-\ntion (m. 135) serves as the beginning of an extensive coda. Note the recurrence of the\ntrio theme in the coda (m. 161), after a deviation into the Neapolitan region.\n\nOp. 7-IV. This rondo is structurally similar to the previous example. The trio is\n\u00e9tude-like, with a striking rhythmic figure offsetting the passage work. The final\nrepetition of a is modified to introduce the coda, this time through an unexpected\nshift to the flat submediant region (B = Cp).\n\nOp. 10/3-IV. All parts of this rondo are relatively short and compact. Both hands\nparticipate in the \u00e9tude-like character in the trio (m. 35-45), which lies in the flat\n\na a a a a a\n\nTHE RONDO FORMS 197\n\nsubmediant region. The retransition (m. 46-55) suggests the principal theme, but\ngives way to octave eighth-notes which are related to the octave sixteenths near the\nend of the trio. The embryonic subordinate idea of m. 17 disappears entirely in\nthe recapitulation and is replaced by a modulatory passage (m. 74-83) built from\nthe basic motive.\n\nOp. 13-III. The trio consists (m. 79) of six versions of the first phrase, separated\nby a four-measure interpolation (m. 95-98) to form a small A-B\u2014a!. The contrapuntal\ninterplay of the two voices is evident. In m. 99-106 the principal notes of each part\nsuccessively are filled in with eighth-notes to produce a descending scale line. The\nend is modified to lead to the dominant of c, upon which an extended but simple\nretransition is built. Other structural features of this rondo were discussed on p. 195.\n\nOp. 28-IV. The exposition and recapitulation exhibit no unusual features. The\npscudo-contrapuntal B-theme is preceded by a transition and followed by a re-\ntransition. There is no connective to introduce the trio. Instead, the first segment of\nthe trio (m. 68-78) takes over the transition function, the previous tonic, D, becoming\nthe dominant of the subdominant region (G). The chief content of the trio lies in the\ncontrapuntal section (m. 79-101). The upper voice of the first four measures appears\nsuccessively in upper, middle and lower voices; in the tonic, dominant and tonic\nminor regions (relative to G). The other voices are varied in m. 87-95 and m. 95-100.\nOtherwise, the treatment is similar to double counterpoint. The remainder (m. 101-\n13) is simply an emphasis of the dominant of d, preparatory to the return of the main\ntheme in D (m. 114). The final repetition of the a-section is varied and extended to\nintroduce the coda.\n\nTHE SONATA-RONDO\n\nThe sonata-rondo, with a modulatory c-section elaborating previous thematic ele-\nments, and the great sonata-rondo, which combines trio structure with the develop-\nment or Durchftihrung, call for treatment like the middle section of the sonata\u2014allegro\nform. This section resembles the modulatory middle section of the scherzo, but is\nusually more elaborately organized.! The exposition and recapitulation need not\ndiffer from those already discussed, though greater complexity and more far-reaching\nmodifications may arise.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 31/1-III. The exposition is normal. The first a-section is immediately repeated\nin a variation placing the main theme in the left hand (m. 17-32). The transition (m.\n33-42) uses the figure from the end of the theme. The c-section begins (m. 82) with\nthe main theme in the left hand (Jike m. 17-32) but in tonic minor. The continuation\nmakes clear that this is the beginning of a modulatory process carried out with\n\n1 A full discussion of this technique is reserved for Chapter XX.\n",
