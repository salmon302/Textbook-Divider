The coda consists of four small segments.\nThe first (m. 208) is six measures long; it quotes and liquidates cadentially the motive\nof the transition (m. 26). The next segment (m. 214-15) quotes and liquidates the\nopening phrase. The third segment (m. 216-17), a further reduction, uses only residues\nof the preceding phrase. The last segment carries the reduction to its logical conclu-\nsion, the repetition of the tonic chord.\n\nNote the progressive reduction of length and content. Of course, this reduction does\nnot occur invariably, and never with mechanical regularity.\n\nOp. 2/2-IV. The last repetition of the main theme prepares for the coda to come\nwith a modulatory deviation in m. 140. But the real coda section begins in m. 148\nwith a segment of eight measures. In m. 156 a part of this is repeated, and, through\nan enharmonic conversion (d# == eb), leads to an episode in the Neapolitan region\n(m. 159). In m. 161 the motive of the trio recurs over an interchange of I and V of\nthe Neapolitan region. The same motive provides the material for dwelling on the\ndominant (m. 165) and the retransition (m. 169). The next segment is a slightly orna-\nmented repetition of the main theme, followed by four short codettas.\n\nOp. 7-IV. Here, too, the last repetition of the rondo theme deviates strikingly, its\na'-section appearing in the Neapolitan region. The remodulation (m. 161-6) makes\nalmost the impression of being the first part of the coda. The next segment, on a\ncadential harmony, is four measures long. The repetition (m. 171) is extended to six\nmeasures, Codettas follow.\n\nOp. 13-II. The coda consists of a two-measure phrase on V-I (m. 67) and its repeti-\ntion. Three one-measure phrases precede the final tonic chords. This coda section is\nextremely simple harmonically.\n\nOp. 28-I. This movement is one of the longest among Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas\u2014\n461 measures. But its coda (twenty-four measures) is proportionately very short, and\nstructurally simple. After a partial quotation of the main theme (m. 439), the last\nmotive-form (m. 446-7) is followed by four repetitions, unvaried except as to the\nupbeats, which ascend climactically in broken-chord form from a! to d\u00ae. The ascension\nis dramatically reinforced by a crescendo, and followed by liquidation reinforced by\na descrescendo.\n\nMozart, String Quartet in D, K.V_ 575-IV. This coda (m. 200) offers an opportunity\nto discuss a technique characteristic of Mozart, the technique of overlapping joints\nwhich resembles dovetailing. It is often a result of extending, for instance, a segment\nof four measures to five, or even six. It is evident that the six measures of Ex. 128a\n(see below) could easily be brought to a definite end in the fourth measure (Ex. 1285)\n\n\"7, 7 \"~ \u00a9 + \u00a5Y\u00a5FY\u00a5VFPFVVFVWTT VY VY\n\nTHE PARTS OF LARGER FORMS 187\n\nand, tnstead of overlapping, the repetition could begin a measure later. But\nMozart's economical mind compensates for the extension by entering one measure\nearly with the repetition.\n\nIn this coda ail the six segments overlap. The second segment starts in m. 205, in\nwhich the first segment ends. It is a repetition, extended to eight measures, or rather\nnine, structurally and functionally, though the completion of the cadence is omitted\nin viola and cello. Similarly the next segment (m. 213-19) is structurally seven mea-\nsures, as its varied repetition (m. 219-25) proves. The last two segments (m. 225-7,\n227-9) are three measures each.\n\nEx.128\nMoxar\u00e9, String Quartet K.V. $75-IV\ny\n\nOp. 57-I. The coda starts in m. 239 with a partial quotation of the subordinate\ntheme, with an expressive deviation in m. 243 to the gp. The segment, m. 243-5, is\nrepeated in m. 246-8. Its end in m. 249 overlaps the beginning of the next segment of\nthree measures, itself repeated in m. 252-4. There follow in m. 255-6 two repetitions\nof the ending of the previous phrase. Thus the length of the elements decreases (6, 4,\n3, 3, 1, 1) throughout a dramatic crescendo. Six measures of tonic harmony follow\n(m. 257-62), diminishing to ppp, dying away upon a reminiscence of the principal\nrhythm.\n\nMozart, String Quartet in C, K.V. 465-I. The first eight measures after the double\nbar (m. 227) are the result of the retransition beginning in m. 220, which leads to the\nsubdominant region, in preparation for the repetition of the elaboration (m. 107).
