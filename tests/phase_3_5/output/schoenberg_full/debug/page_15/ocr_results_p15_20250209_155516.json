Consciously used, the motive should produce unity, relation-\nship, coherence, logic, comprehensibility and fluency.\n\nThe motive generally appears in a characteristic and impressive manner at the\nbeginning of a piece. The features of a motive are intervals and rhythms, combined to\nproduce a memorable shape or contour which usually implies an inherent harmony.\nInasmuch as almost every figure within a piece reveals some relationship to it, the\nbasic motive is often considered the \u2018germ\u2019 of the idea. Since it includes elements, at\nleast, of every subsequent musical figure, one could consider it the \u2018smallest common\nmultiple\u2019. And since it is included in every subsequent figure, it could be considered\nthe \u2018greatest common factor\u2019.\n\nHowever, everything depends on its use. Whether a motive be simple or complex,\nwhether it consists of few or many features, the final impression of the piece is not\ndetermined by its primary form. Everything depends on its treatment and develop-\nment.\n\nA motive appears constantly throughout a piece: it is repeated. Repetition alone\noften gives rise to monotony. Monotony can only be overcome by variation.\n\nUse of the motive requires variation\n\nVariation means change. But changing every feature produces something foreign,\nincoherent, illogical. It destroys the basic shape of the motive.\n\nAccordingly, variation requires changing some of the less-important features and\npreserving some of the more-important ones. Preservation of rhythmic features\neffectively produces coherence (though monotony cannot be avoided without slight\nchanges). For the rest, determining which features are more important depends on the\ncompositional objective. Through substantial changes, a variety of motive-forms,\nadapted to every formal function, can be produced.\n\nHomophonic music can be called the style of \u2018developing variation\u2019. This means that\nin the succession of motive-forms produced through variation of the basic motive,\nthere is something which can be compared to development, to growth. But changes\nof subordinate meaning, which have no special consequences, have only the loca]\neffect of an embellishment. Such changes are better termed variants.\n\nwrwweveveevere eur er ewer eer er ere ee\n\nTHE MOTIVE 9\n\nWHAT CONSTITUTES A MOTIVE\n\nAny rhythmicized succession of notes can be used asa basic motive, but there should\nnot be too many different features.\n\nRhythmic features may be very simple, even for the main theme of a sonata (Ex.\n12a). A symphony can be built on scarcely more complex rhythmic features (Exs. 128,\nc, 13). The examples from Beethoven's Fifth symphony consist primarily of note-\nrepetitions, which sometimes contribute distinctive characteristics.\n\nA motive need not contain a great many interval features. The main theme of\nBrahms\u2019s Fourth symphony (Ex. 13), though also containing sixths and octaves, is,\nas the analysis shows, constructed on a succession of thirds.\n\nOften a contour or shape is significant, although the rhythmic treatment and inter-\nvals change. The upward leap in Ex. 12a; the movement up by step in Ex. 16; the\nupward sweep followed by a return within it which pervades Beethoven's Op. 2/3~IV,}\nillustrate such cases.\n\nEvery element or feature of a motive or phrase must be considered to be a motive\nif it is treated as such, i.e. if it is repeated with or without variation.\n\nTREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF THE MOTIVE\n\nA motive is used by repetition. The repetition may be exact, modified or developed.\n\n\u00a3xact repetitions preserve all features and relationships. Transpositions to a different\ndegrce, inversions, retrogrades, diminutions and augmentations are exact repetitions\nif they preserve strictly the features and note relations (Ex. 14).\n\nModified repetitions are created through variation. They provide variety and produce\nnew material (motive-forms) for subsequent use.\n\nSome variations, however, are merely local \u2018variants\u2019 and have little or no influence\non the continuation.\n\nVariation, it must be remembered, is repetition in which some features are changed\nand the rest preserved.\n\nAll the features of rhythm, interval, harmony and contour are subject to various\nalterations. Frequently, several methods of variation are applied to several features\nsimultaneously ; but such changes must not produce a motive-form too foreign to the\nbasic motive. In the course of a piece, a motive-form may be developed further through\nsubsequent variation. Exs. 15 and 16 are illustrations.\n\nCOMMENT ON EXAMPLES\n\nIn Exs. 17-29, based solely on a broken chord, some of the methods which can be\napplied are shown as systematically as is practicable.\n\n! References to the literature identified only by opus number apply to Beethoven piano sonatas. Because\nof their general accessibility, a great many references to them appear in the later chapters.\n\na es\n",
