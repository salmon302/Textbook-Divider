Although this movement is called a minuet, the\ncontrasting middle section, in its sequentiation and gradual liquidation, resembles the\npractice form of the scherzo middle section. In contrast, the Scherzo of Symphony\nNo, 2 has little elaboration of this type.\n\nSymphony No. 3, Scherzo. The first ten measures of the Durchftihrung utilize the\nmotive-forms of m. | 4 in a chromatic ascension to reach the supertonic. Here the\nsecond element of the theme (m. 7-14) is quoted. The last four measures (m. 95-98)\nare split off and sequenced, modulating to V of the mediant, which, curiously, is\ndwelt upon for sixteen measures, as if it were the upbeat chord. Four measures of By,\nrepresenting the dominant, substitute for an upbeat chord.\n\nSymphony No. 4 JII. The modulation is carried out by means of many sequences\nof a four-measure pattern, which is liquidated by reduction to two measures, one\nmeasure and finally to two-thirds of a measure.\n\nSymphony No. 7-II. This movement is scherzo-like in character, tempo and Durch-\nfithrung. The modulation follows the circle of fifths from mediant major to sub-\ndominant. At this point one of those \u2018recapitulations in the wrong key\u2019 occurs which\nappear occasionally in Beethoven\u2019s later works.\n\nString Quartet, Op. 18/1, Scherzo. A three-measure pattern (in flat mediant) is\nsequenced in tonic minor. A two-measure pattern (m. 17) followed by three sequences\nleads to the dominant.\n\nString Quartet, Op. 18/2, Scherzo. The contrast is chiefly harmonic, without elabora-\ntion of the basic motive.\n\nString Quartet, Op. 18/6, Scherzo. The contrasting section remains substantially\nin the tonic region, but somewhat elaborates the basic motive.\n\nBrahms, Sextet, Op. 18, Scherzo. Here the contrast is not produced by sequences,\nbut by fluently passing through tonic minor and flat submediant major regions. The\nelaboration is carried out exclusively with imitations of the leading motive.\n\nBrahms, Sextet, Op. 36, Scherzo. The elaboration is organized in imitative se-\nquences, distributed as a dialogue between upper and lower voices.\n\nThese illustrations show the inexhaustible diversity of construction. They also show\nthat there is such a wide latitude for the fantasy of the composer that only a trained\nmind can control it. Hence, composition in the practice form must be supplemented\nwith analysis of master works.\n\nTHE RECAPITULATION\n\nDisregarding literal repetition, the recapitulation may be changed, modified, varied\nor reconstructed as described on p. 123.\n\nOp. 2/3, Scherzo. The recapitulation is modified so that both antecedent and con-\nsequent end on the tonic.\n\nOp. 26, Scherzo. The recapitulation is enriched by the addition of a counter melody\n\nrwvwrr Pvwvervrerevrrrerreere\n\nTHE SCHERZO 155\n\nin the right hand; the principal melody is lowered an octave, appearing in the left\nhand. The written-out repetition, which was varied in the A-section, by the addition\nof passing notes, is varied in the recapitulation by interchange of the voices (m. 53--\n60), as in double counterpoint.\n\nThe a!-section of many scherzos differs from the A-section in including extensions\nof the recapitulation, episades and added codettas.\n\nEXTENSIONS, EPISODES AND CODETTAS\n\nExtension is usually produced by repetition (often sequential) of an element. In\nsimple cases it is associated with a turn toward the subdominant (e.g. Becthoven,\nSymphony No. 1-IID; in others a real modulation occurs. Motivally, if it is not the\nsimple repetition of a segment (as in the Septet, Op. 20), it usually consists of a\ndeveloping elaboration of preceding motive-forms.\n\nEpisodes interrupt the norma! flow of a section. They dwell upon such progressions\nas neither modulate nor produce a cadence. They often settle down in a more or less\nremote contrasting region, especially if within a modulatory section. They often intro-\nduce smal] phrases, strangely foreign to the previously used motive-forms (e.g. Op.\n2/2-I11, m. 19 ff., discussed below).\n\nCodettas are primarily cadences. They serve as reaffirmations of the ending of a\nsection. Harmonically, they may consist of the most rudimentary cadence, V-I; or\nthey may be highly complex. Motivally, they may range from simple repetitions of\nsmall elements to rather independent formulations.?\n\nFurther illustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/2, Scherzo. An episode which is both motivally and harmonically remote\nbegins in m. 19. It is connected with the basic material merely by its upbeat, which is\nrelated to the tone repetitions of m. 3. The remoteness of the region makes a relatively\nlong and rapid remodulation necessary. A simple codetta at the end provides the full\ncadence which was missing in the recapitulation proper.\n\nOp. 2/3, Scherzo. The codettas (m. 56-64) hint at the subdominant minor, and\nbecome plagal in the liquidated form, m. 61.\n\nOp. 26, Scherzo. The recapitulation is extended with two slightly varied repetitions\nof the last two-measure phrase (m. 59-60), and brought to a close with liquidating\nreductions.\n\nString Quartet, Op. 18/1, Scherzo, The a?-section consists of an extended re-\ncapitulation (the extension is in m. 43-46), followed by an episode (m. 51-63) built\nfrom the element which appears in m. 49-50. The first five measures of the recapitula-\n\n1 Usually, if more than one codetta appears, the later ones are shortened, often in the manner of a\nliquidation.\n",
