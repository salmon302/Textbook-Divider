Variations derives from the melodic\nprogression from the Bb of the first measure to the D in the third. Brahms converts\nthis into a harmonic progression by transplanting it to the bass as a root progression:\ntonic-mediant. Thus the mediant in the third measure in Variations 7,9, lt, 14and 19\nis utilized to lead to cadences on the dominant, or on the mediant (major or minor).\nJn the minor variations (5, 6 and 13) the third measures stand on mediant major\n(Dp), and the cadences lead to V, Il and V. Among other interesting harmonic varia-\ntions, in Variation 4 the third measure is VI, and in Variation 17 it is I'V (instead of I\nor HP).\n\nThe twentieth variation is characterized by chromatic movement in melody and\nbass. In the ninth variation, the B-section begins on the dominant (F); but the written-\nout repetition begins on F# (in the meaning of Gp), establishing the closely related\nregion of flat submediant major.\n\nCOUNTERPOINT IN VARIATIONS\n\nIn some respects alt variations have a certain relation to counterpoint, if only to\nthe preliminary exercises: the five species\u2014-adding one or more voices to a \u2018cantus\nfirmus\u2019. In variations, the theme acts as cantus firmus; perhaps also the acceleration\nof the motus derives from this source.\n\nBut every sort of contrapuntal treatment may be found, and sometimes the entire\norganization of a variation is based upon contrapuntal procedures. Structural changes\nmay be very far-reaching when, for instance, a fugue is built upon a derivative of the\ntheme.\n\nHlustrations from the literature\n\nBeethoven, 32 Variations in c minor. Most of the variations consist in adding one or\nmore voices to the basic scheme. The procedure, with respect to the bass, is similar to\nthe passacaglias of Bach and Brahms, and the ostinato finale of Brahms\u2019s Haydn\nVariations.\n\nOf a higher order are those variations which display combinative counterpoint.\nFree imitations appear in Variation 17; a canon in Variation 22. Variations 10 and\n11. 20 and 21 are in double counterpoint at the octave.\n\nBeethoven, Variations in Ep, Op. 35. Variation 7 is canonic, and the set is concluded\nwith a Finale alla Fuga.\n\nBeethoven, Diabelli Variations. Contrapuntal devices include: a fugue (Variation\n32) and a fughetta (Variation 24), canonic imitation in Variations 19 and 20, and free\nimitation in many others, e.g. 4, 11, 14, 20 and 30.\n\nBrahms, Handel Variations. The Finale is again a fugue. Variation 6 is a canon;\n\nrYrYYS2eFFTTVPTFerT Se\n\nTHEME AND VARIATIONS 173\n\nVariation 8 is based on double counterpoint at the octave. Quasi-contrapuntal pianistic\nimitations contribute to the coherence within Variations 16, 18, 23 and 24.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of contrapuntal artistry, Variations 4 and 8 of Brahms\u2019s Varia-\ntions on a Theme of Haydn, Op. 56a, are of particular interest. Variation 4 consists of\ndouble, or rather triple, counterpoint, invertible at the octave and twelfth. Variation 8\ncontains a complex of mirror forms in multiple counterpoint.\n\nSKETCHING THE VARIATIONS\n\nIn preparation for the composition of a set of variations, the theme should be\nthoroughly explored and the best openings for variations determined. After the theme\nhas been reduced to its essentials, a large number of sketches, which explore a variety\nof motives of variation, should be made. Even if many of them prove stiff and awk-\nward, or if an otherwise promising motive turns out to be unworkable, nevertheless\nthe composer acquires an intimate acquaintance with the theme, its possibilities, and\nthe limitations it imposes. Often elements of different sketches may be combined to\nprovide a striking and effective motive of variation.\n\nFrom the many partial sketches the more promising may then be selected for com-\npletion and polishing. ,\n\nCOMMENT ON EXAMPLES 126\n\nIn Ex. 1264 a skeleton is derived from Beethoven's Piano Sonata, Op. 79-III. In\nthis particular case little more than the simplified melody and the bass proves neces-\nsary. The following examples illustrate the application of a number of simple motives\nof variation.\n\nIn Ex. 1266 the melody notes are circumscribed with appoggiaturas and intervening\nsixteenth-notes, which provide continuous movement. The bass is subjected only to\na slight rhythmic change. In this somewhat primitive treatment the main notes always\nappear at the same point in the figurc.\n\nEx. 126\u00a2 achieves more fluency and variety by avoiding such mechanical reitera-\ntion; the main notes are somewhat freely distributed, though they remain in the same\nhalf-measure. A simple figuration is applied to the accompaniment. The variety in\nEx. 126d, in which notes of various lengths are used, is even greater.\n\nIn Ex. 126e the bass is treated as the melodic voice and the upper elements become\nthe accompaniment.\n\n_The accompaniment in Ex. 126d, f and g, is the object of considerable variation\nthrough rhythmic changes, use of inversions and harmonic enrichment.\n\nEx, 126g is carried out completely. The motive-forms are shifted and further varied\nin the region of the cadence. The rhythmic figure ai evolves to maintain the motus,\nand the suspensions of the motive of variation are split into separate eighths in\nm. 6-7.\n\na 2\n",
