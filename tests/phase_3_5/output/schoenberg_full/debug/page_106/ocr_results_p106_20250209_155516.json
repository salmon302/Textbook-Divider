Two three-measure and two two-measure segments follow, and the customary\nrepetitions of the tonic.\n\nThe coda of a set of variations need not differ from the coda of any other type of\nmovement. But since classical variations seldom contain greater harmonic contrast\nthan maggiore\u2014minore, the coda usually contains more striking harmonic contrasts\nand modulatory deviations.\n\nBeethoven, String Quartet, Op. 18/5-III. The coda section starts (m. 98), after a\ndeceptive progression, on the flat submediant (Bp). It consists of a number of seg-\nments which elaborate in combination the first two phrases of the theme. In other\nrespects it does not differ from the cases previously described.\n\nMozart, String Quartet in d, K.V. 421-IV. The coda begins (m. 113) with a sub-\nstantially unvaried quotation of the first eight measures of the theme. To describe\nall the miraculous subtleties of this coda would take pages. The numerous small seg-\nments which follow are, for the most part, contrapuntal additions to the prevailing\nrhythmic figure. Occasional insertions and shifts cause the length of the segments to\nvary, producing typical Mozartean irregularity.\n\nMozart, String Quartet in A, K.V. 464-III, Andante.' The coda of these variations\nstarts with a pedal using the rhythm which gave this movement the nickname \u2018Drum\nVariations\u2019. It consists of a number of segments, one of which is a condensed quota-\ntion of the theme (compare m. 164 with m. 1; m. 169 with m. 6 and 14). The segment\nbeginning in m. 174 is derived, not from the theme itself, but from the fifth variation\n(m. 115 ff.).\n\nAmong Beethoven\u2019s three largest sets of piano variations, the Ep has a fugal finale.\nThe coda of the c Variations is attached to the end of the thirty-second variation. It\ncontains no modulation; but it incorporates an additional variation, extended to ten\nmeasures (m. 19-28), and is concluded with a few codettas. The coda of the Diabelli\nVariations, which is also attached to the last variation, does not differ from the codas\npreviously described.\n\nBeethoven, Twelve Variations in A. The coda comprises about a third of the whole\nwork, and is very rich in the number and remoteness of the modulations. At one point\nit even reaches a region which must be described as the \u2018mediant major of the domi-\nnant\u2019, on Ab.\n\nBeethoven, Twelve Variations \u2018iiber die (') Menuett (in 4/4) a la Vigano\u2019. This coda\nalso modulates to a remote point, the supertonic major (D).\n\nBeethoven, Ten Variations in Bp. The coda (beginning in m. 47 of Variation 10)\ncontains much passage work. There are two partial variations in the tonic region (m.\n\n1 The Philharmonia score prints this movement as the third; but this is questionable, for in the Peters\nEdition, it appears as the fourth. Probably it should be the second.\n\nTHE PARTS OF LARGER FORMS 189\n\n103, 119). two episodes in submediant (m. 47) and Neapolitan (m. 146) regions.\nCodettas (Tempo 1) complete the reduction and liquidation.\n\nThe preceding analyses have shown the great diversity of formal possibilities.\nA number of features are common to most of them. Seldom is a theme established\nwith the self-sufficiency and independence of a main theme. Varied quotations of\nprevious themes are often condensed into small segments, and connected by modu-\nlatory passages, which themselves may consist of previous material. When, after a\nmodulatory contrast, the tonic region is re-established, a longer segment usually\nfollows. Finally, a number of codettas appear, becoming shorter and shorter, the\ncontent progressively reduced to a mere V~I, or even to a repetition of J.\n",
