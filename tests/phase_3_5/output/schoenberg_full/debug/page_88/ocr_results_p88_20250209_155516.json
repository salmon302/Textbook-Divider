It is also advisable to provide for repetitions of clearly delimited\nsegments, reasonable in Iength.\n\nHarmonically, these segments should be built as patterns for sequences. Themati-\ncally, they should possess a certain degree of independence; the combination of\nmotive-forms may resemble that in the antecedent of the period, or the middle section\nof the ternary form. But motive-forms from the a-section will have to be modified or\nadapted to the modulatory procedure. The order may be changed, and some of the\nforms may be repeated within the segment (e.g. abuc, abcc, abbc, aaab, etc.). Because\nof the modulation, remotely varied motive-forms are dangerous.\n\nIn the practice form the pattern is followed by a sequence. It should begin on a\ndegree related to the ending of the a-section. In Ex. 122 there are twenty-five illustra-\ntions of patterns with scquences, all derived from the A-section shown, They begin\non various degrees, such as V, v, HH, 1, iil, bIII, ti, iv, \u00a54, etc. The patterns of Exs.\n1226, c and d begin alike but continue differently. In a number of cases different\nsequences are given for the same pattern. Variation of the sequence is illustrated in\nExs. 1227, 5. f,4, \u00a5, Nand v. Particularly noteworthy are those in which the principal\nvoice shifts to a different voice, sometimes using the opportunities of double counter-\npoint.\n\nIn order to control the modulation, the pattern must be built so that the end of the\nlast sequence oilers an opening for the return to an appropriate upbeat harmony,\npreparing for the recapitulation. For instance, the sixteenth measure of Exs. 122/ and\nmare too remote to be neutralized through simple procedures.\n\nThe emphasis contributed by a sequence (a form of repetition) creates obligations.\nIt is necessary to neutralize these obligations in order to introduce the recapitulation\nin a manner at once \u2018surprising and expected\u2019, as Beethoven expressed it.\n\nThis is accomplished by the technique of figuidation, i.e. by gradually depriving\nthe motive-forms of their characteristic features and dissolving them into un-\ncharacteristic forms, such as scales, broken chords, etc. A striking example is the\nScherzo of Beethoven\u2019s Op. 26, After the sequence, the four-measure pattern is re-\nduced to two (m. 25. 26); after a varied repetition, it is further reduced to five notes\n(m. 28); to four notes (m. 29- 30); to two notes (m. 33 ff.); and to one note (m. 41 ff.).\nObserve that the upbeat harmony is reached at the beginning of the first reduction\n(m. 25) and continued through m. 44.\n\nIf, in the practice form, the end of the sequence does not connect readily with the\nupbeat harmony, further modulation is necessary. This can be accomplished through\nadditional sequences, but in order to start the liquidation, the pattern should be\nreduced, ordinarily to half of the previous length.\n\nIn Ex, 122 various techniques of continuation after the first sequence are illustrated.\nTn Ex. 122a the reduced pattern is made simply by omitting the third and fourth mea-\nsures of the original pattern. The contour of the pattern (m. 9-12) has been depreciated\n\nTHE SCHERZO 153\n\ninto the inconspicuous form of a descending scale Hine. Such unpretentious forms as\nscale lines, broken chords, and the like, are neutral enough to cancel the emphasis of\nthe sequential process. M. 25-29 dwell on the dominant, with an ostinato-like treat-\nment of residues.\n\nThe brackets in m. 21 ff. of Exs. 1226, \u00a2 and \u00a2 indicate the reduction of the pre-\nceding two-measure pattern to two notes.\n\nThe end of the liquidation is generally marked by a combination of repose and\nsuspense: repose through cessation of the modulatory movement; suspense in anti-\ncipatton of the re-entrance of the theme. At this point, the retarding effect of a pedal\npoint is appropriate; it keeps at least the bass from progressing. As an inverted pedal,\nit can also be a sustained or repeated note in another voice. The pedal can be de-\nveloped into a pedal figure (in Ex. 122/, m. 20. 22, all three upper voices participate in\nsuch an ostinato-like formulation). In Ex. 122d, m. 17-21, part of the modulation is\ncarried out similarly.\n\nHlastrations from the literature\n\nMost of the scherzos and scherzo-like movements in classic music have in common\nonly one feature, that the modulation is carried out at least in part by sequential treat-\nment. The following are particularly worth study: Beerhoven: Piano sonatas, Op.\n2/2, Op. 2/3, Op. 26, Op. 28; Septet, Op. 20; Symphonies |, 2, 4, 7, 9; String Quartets,\nOp. 18/1, Op. 18/2, Op. 18/6; Brahms: Sextets, Op. 18, Op. 36.\n\nIn some cases, the modulation is interrupted by an episode which settles down for\na time, often at a point harmonically remote (e.g, Op. 2'2, Symphony H). A remodu-\nlation follows, using residues or other derivatives.\n\nAs soon as the upbeat harmony is reached, further modulation or remodulation\nbecomes unnecessary, as in Op. 26, where the shortened segment already stands on\nthe upbeat harmony,\n\nOp. 28, Scherzo. The contrasting middle section does not contain a real modula-\nlion, but merely passes through a number of harmonies with the aid of artificial\ndominants. Even the upbeat chord is introduced in an unusual manner and in the\nimperfect form of a 6/5 chord. The adequacy of this contrast is based on the harmonic\npeculiarities of the other sections and the trio. The ambiguity of the opening /# (most\nstrongly felt after the b minor of the trio) requires a clear definition of the tonic, D.\nAfter several more or less contradictory deviations, the tonality becomes firmly\nestablished only at the end of the recapitulation, with the aid of several codettas.\n\nMotivally, the construction of this middle section depends on the sustained D, E,\n\u20183, G in the upper voice, each four measures long, like the initial F\u00a3: and the octave\nleaps in the bass. Below these sustained notes, the bass, accompanied by upper thirds,\nproceeds chromatically from F4 to C4. The regularity of this procedure makes a\nmotive-like impression.\n",
