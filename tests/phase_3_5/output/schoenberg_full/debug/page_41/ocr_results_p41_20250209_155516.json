Only in Exs. 54d and 556 is the order the same as in the first phrase. In Exs.\n54e, f, the order is reversed (*b\u2019\u2014\u2018a\u2019). In Ex. 56, only \u201cb' and \u2018c\u2019 are used. Note that the\npattern in Ex. 55a begins with a transposition of that feature which ended the pre-\nceding phrase (\u2018c!\u2019, m. 8) and associates it with \u201cb\u2019 in the form used in m. 3 and 7.\nObserve also the treatment of the motive of the accompaniment, \u2018e\u2019, which (as shown\nby the analysis in terms of 6/4 metre) is shifted from the weak to the strong measure\nin m. 9-10.\n\nHlustrations from the literature\n\nAmong Exs. 57-61, from Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and Brahms, there are\ncases in which the scheme, tonic form\u2014dominant form, is replaced by a different\nkind of repetition (see Chapter V).\n\nIn almost all of these the continuation after the repetition of the first phrase is\ncarried out with condensed phrases giving way to a cadence contour, described in the\npreceding chapter. Generally these closing measures employ only residues of the basic\nmotive.\n\nAs a practice form is only an abstraction from art forms, sentences from master-\nworks often differ considerably from the scheme. Among the illustrations the most\nobvious deviation lies in the number of measures\u2014there may be either more or less\nthan eight (or multiples of eight). The beginning of Mozart's Overture to The Marriage\nof Figaro (Ex. 59i) is only seven measures.\n\nA length exceeding eight measures is often caused by the use of remote motive-\nforms, whose establishment demands more than a single repetition; or by the con-\nnexion of units of unequal size (e.g. one measure plus two measures); or by insertions.\n\nEx 530 is such a case. The motive-form in m. 5, though based on the interval of a\nthird, derives indirectly from the figure marked \u2018b\u2019, which could be understood as an\nembellished syncopation, This is a very remote variation, whose repetitions account\nfor the length of twelve measures.\n\nIt is characteristic of Mozart\u2019s Rococo technique to produce irregularity within the\nphrasing through interpolation of incidental repetitions of small segments, residues of\na preceding phrase.\n\nIn Ex. 59a, after the two one-measure phrases in m. 5 and 6, a segment of three\nmeasures (repeated with a slight variation) appears. The example could be reduced to\nten measures if m. 10-12 were omitted. Testing which measures could be omitted is\nthe best method to discover what causes the extension. Omitting m. 7-11 would reduce\nthe example to the eight measures of the practice form, indicating that these measures\nshould be considered an insertion, from which the extension results.\n\nIn Ex. 595, m. 5-6 could be omitted.!\n\n1 The succession of two 6/4 chords in m. 7 and 9 is most unusual. One might suspect a misprint for such a\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE THEMES (4) 61\n\nIn Ex. 59c the omission of m. 7-8 reduces the ten measures to eight.\n\nEx. 59d is more complicated. The end of this sentence coincides with (overlaps) the\nbeginning of a repetition. Nevertheless, it cannot be considered less than nine mea-\nsures, The extension is produced by a sequence in m. 6-7.\n\nIn Ex. 594, m. 5-6 are made up of remotely varied motive-forms, because of which\na modified repetition follows in m. 7-8. Such extra repetitions are certainly con-\nsequences of the requirements of comprehensibility.\n\nThe ending (on VI) of Ex. 60a is unusual. Still more unusual is the anticipation of\nV1 (through a deceptive cadence) in m. 10. Were this not the work of a master one\nwould be inclined to call ita weakness. Certainly either of the two alternative versions\nwould be safer for a student. These last four measures make the impression of\ncodettas; if they are, the preceding eight measures might be considered a period. But\nanalysis as a sentence is supported by the similarity of the two segments, m. 1-4 and\nm. 5 8. to tonic form and dominant form. This hypothesis would lead one to expect\na continuation of eight measures.\n\nIn Ex. 60c the beginning, on \u00a54-II, is remarkable, The Finale of Beethoven's String\nQuartet, Op. 130, begins similarly.\n\nIn Ex, 60\u00a2 the (quasi-sequential) repetition of a short segment (m. 7-12) and the\ncondensation in the cadence show a certain similarity to the practice form. Otherwise,\nthe preceding six measures have merely an introductory character.\n\nThe first six measures of Ex. 60/consist of two units of three measures cach, organ-\nized similarly to the tonic- and dominant-form. These three-measure segments are not\nproduced by reduction or extension, but by quasi-sequential insertions, repetitions of\nm. 2 and 4.!\n\nOmitting m. 7-11 and m. 13 would reduce Ex. 60A to the eight measures of the\npractice form. However, m. 7-14 could also be considered as an independent addition\nof four measures with a varied repetition. Though \u2018a,\u2019 is an augmentation of \u2018a\u2019, the\nphrase in m. 7-8 must be considered a remote variation, justifying the repetition.\n\nThe analysis of Ex. 6la shows that the theme is less complicated than it appears at\nfirst glance. (The theme or melody need not, of course, always be in the highest voice.\nAccompaniment and melody may exchange places in various ways. Naturally, the\n\nbass as that indicated below m. 6-7. Such a treatment of a 6/4 chord would scarcely be found elsewhere in\nMozart. But since he uses the same 6/4 for a cadence to | (m. 25, 27), one must abandon the idea of a misprint.\nMisprint or stroke of genius, it is hardly a model for the student to imitate.\n\n' Schubert was distinctly one of the pioneers in the field of harmony. The singularity of his harmonic\nfeeling can be observed in the ending of Ex, 60b. As a varied repetition of m. 1-8, m. 9-16 should end on\n{: but instead the repetition ends on the subdominant! That this is no weakness is evident from the recapitula-\ntien, which starts on the subdominant (instead of the tonic) but ends on the tonic, though a strict trans-\nposition would have ended on Ab. Thus the harmonic scheme is 1-1V :1V-I. If he had used the procedure of\nthe recapitulation in im. 15 16, the cadence would have led in m. 16 to V.\n\nSuch discussion is not intended as criticism of the masters, but rather as a warning to the student against\nharmunie procedures which are beyond his control,\n",
