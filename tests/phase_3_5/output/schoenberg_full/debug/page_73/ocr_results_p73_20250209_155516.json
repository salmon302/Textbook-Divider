The middle section begins (m. |1) with a stronger contrast than the\ndominant, the flat mediant (pIIE). According to the principle of multiple meaning it\nis reinterpreted in m. 12 as HI of the tonic minor, which then leads in m. 14 to the\ncommon dominant of the tonic major and minor. The extension of the a-section and\nthe a!-section by the addition of m. 8 9 and m. 22--23 constitutes another difference\nfrom the practice form.\n\nEx. 102c. The antecedent of the opening period (m. 1-12). becomes six measures\nlong through repetitions of the motive-form \u2018b\u2019. The alternative analysis, \u2018c\u2019, demon-\nstrates the overlapping, chain-like, construction. The recapitulation (m. 17-22) is\nreduced to six measures. It uses chiefly the motive-form \u2018b\u2019, avoiding monotony by\nreorganization and by omitting the motive-form \u2018a\u2019, which was the exclusive material\nof the middle section.!\n\nEx, 102d. The motival derivation of the rich ornamentation, which might seem\narbitrary at first glance, is analysed and traced back to a few basic forms.\n\nEx. 102e. The deceptive cadence in m. 8 of the A-section requires an added cadence\nto the dominant, which extends the section to ten measures. The recapitulation, partly\n(m. 23-24) a free reconstruction, becomes nine measures through the developing\nrepetition in m. 22. The contrasting middle section (m. 11-17) dwells on the dominant\nof the tonic minor, partly as a pedal point. A mere interchange of harmonies (I-V;\n#-V) leads repeatedly to the dominant. In m. 13-17 the bass is omitted, on the sup-\nposition that the mind retains the pedal point\u2014perhaps because the upper three voices\nexpress the harmony definitely cnough. The extension to seven measures is the result\nof the inserted measure 13 and the additions, m. 16 and 17.\n\nEx. 103, by Mozart, possesses the simplicity and impressiveness so necessary in a\ntheme for variations. It demonstrates that sufficient variety can be produced by means\nas simple as shifting to other harmonies, changing the intervals and extending the\nphrases to two measures. The elaboration through imitations, in the middle section,\ncreates an excellent contrast to the homophonic style of the rest.\n\nEx, 104, Schubert. The contrasting middle section is noteworthy because it turns\nin m. 11 to the suabmediant region (vi) and ends on its V (HH of the tonic region). This,\nin turn, influences the curious harmony at the beginning of the recapitulation, m. 13\n(see explanation in Exs. 104d, c).\n\nCOMMENT ON EXAMPLES\nEx. 105 shows how ten different continuations can be derived from a single\n\n1 This example can also be analysed as a baroque binary structure, in which the harmony moves from Ito\n\u00a5V in the first half and from V to I in the second; the motive-forms are similarly distributed in the two sections.\n\n- SO ac). et ee ee\n\nTHE SMALL TERNARY FORM 123\n\nvi), all but one can be joined to the original a-section, ending on I. The basic phrase\nis a derivative of Ex. 21d.\n\nObserve the various types of piano style and the treatment of the motive of the\naccompaniment (indicated by m, n, 0, p). The features of the basic motive appearing\nin the A-section (marked a, b, c, d) are used subsequently, and combined with those\nof the motive of the accompaniment as logical connectives.\n\nThe upbeat chord at the end of all these a-sections is V, sometimes postponed to the\nlast eighth or sixteenth,\n\nIn middle sections 1, 3, 7, 8 and 9 the minor tonic and minor subdominant are\neffectively contrasted with the ensuing return of the major in the recapitulation.\n\nThe harmonic procedure is sufficiently analysed in the examples themselves. The\nstudent should exploit, in like manner, all degrees, in order to expand his harmonic\nknowledge, even at the risk of overburdening so small a form. By this means, he can\ndevelop his harmonic resources and skill to meet the demands of larger and more\ncomplex forms.\n\nTHE UPBEAT CHORD\n\nThe B-section ends on a harmony which leads to the recapitulation. In classical\nmusic this harmony is the dominant, because it reintroduces the tonic in its tonality-\ndefining sense. Its effect in such cases is comparable to that of an upbeat to the sub-\nsequently accentuated downbeat. Because of this function, such chords will be called\n\u2018upbeat chords\u2019, regardless of their rhythmic placement.\n\nOther harmonies, and transformations of them, can also function as connectives.\nEx. 106 shows examples of ti and iti (and their derivatives) used as upbeat harmonies\nto I. In Exs. 107a, 6 and c, the recapitulation does not begin on I. In such cases the\nupbeat chord must be chosen accordingly. In Ex. 1075 the upbeat harmony is pI,\nintroducing the recapitulation which begins on V. In Ex. 107a the recapitulation\nbegins on H, introduced by bVI. Of course, if the first two harmonies of the re-\ncapitulation were reversed, the p VI could as logically introduce I (Ex. 107c).\n\nTHE RECAPITULATION (A?)\n\nThe recapitulation may be an unchanged repetition. More frequently it is changed,\nmodified or varied. Changes may be necessary to establish a definite ending, especially\nif the A-section ends on a degree other than I. Shortening (by elimination, reduction\nor condensation) may help to avoid monotony. Lengthening (by insertion, inter-\npolated repetitions, extension or addition) may create emphasis.\n\nModification of both melody and harmony may be necessary to accommodate such\nchanges.\n\nThe principles of variation can be applied to all the elements of the A-section, but\nwith moderation, so as not to conceal the presence of a repetition. Thus, the contour\n\n",
