A distinct contrast\nof character helps to distinguish the various themes, though analysis will demonstrate\ntheir inter-connexion through common use of basic motive-features.\n\nIt differs from the rondos in that the principal theme is not repeated prior to the\nelaboration, and there is no return to the principal key. Instead, a closing section, still\nin a contrasting region, completes the exposition. Often this is a mere group of\ncodettas, Occasionally, a formulation derived from the principal theme provides the\nmaterial (String Quartet, Op. 18/1-I, m. 72; Op. 18/6\u2014I, m. 80; Mozart, Symphony\nin g, K.V. 550-1, m. 66). But generally a special theme, adapted to cadential harmonies,\nis introduced, which may be reminiscent of any of the preceding themes, or quite\ndistinct.\n\nTHE PRINCIPAL THEME (OR GROUP)\n\nThe structure may vary widely\u2014from a straightforward period or sentence, through\nsomething resembling a ternary form, to a group of distinct themes joined in the most\nsubtle fashion. Often a return to the A-theme merges into a transition.\n\nThe ideas of the principal group are nearly always more thematic than melodic\n(see Chapter XI) and the internal organization tends to be flexible and irregular, fore-\ncasting the metamorphoses to which the ideas will later be subjected. If the structure\nis too symmetrical, subsequent freedom of articulation may be impeded. A striking,\nmotto-like beginning is a useful feature (Op. 2/2-I, Op. 7-I, Op. 10/1-I, Op. 10/2-1,\nOp. 22-I, String Quartet, Op. 95-I).\n\nillustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/i-I. The theme, a simple sentence, is eight measures long. A transposition of\nit provides material for a short transition which is quickly liquidated, and the sub-\nordinate theme follows in m. 21.\n\nOp. 2/2~-1. There are two distinct ideas here: the motto-like beginning built from\ndescending broken chords, and the more lyrical continuation (m. 9). Both elements\nare repeated in shortened. form (m. 21) and brought to a definite cadence in m. 32.\nThe free articulation of phrases of varying lengths within the thirty-two measures\nplaces the chief internal cadence (to the dominant) in m. 20.\n\nOp. 7-1. After the motto-like beginning (m. 1-4), a series of two-measure phrases\nextend to m. 13, where an overlapping varied repetition further extends the passage\nto m. 17. But here, still further extension takes place through a partially liquidated\ncontinuation of the eighth-note passage work, which suggests a close in m. 25.\nHowever, a varied repetition of the opening motto inaugurates the transition.\n\nOp. 10/1-I. The initial segment (m. 1-4) contains two sharply contrasted character-\nistics. The tonic form is immediately followed by a dominant form. The linkage in\nm. 4-5 and 8-9 is so intimate that the phrase endings almost disappear. The two-\nmeasure phrase which is repeated and liquidated in the ensuing eight measures is\n\ni a a a id\n\nTHE SONATA-ALLEGRO 203\n\nagain a distinct, though related, motive-form. Several cadential additions lead to a\nderivative of the first two measures, which appears three times, leading to a cadence\nin m. 30.\n\nOp. 10/2-I. The twelve-measure theme consists of three segments very rich in\nmotive-forms. The repetition of the beginning in m. 13 leads at once to the dominant\nof iii, in lieu of a transition.\n\nOp. 10/3--I. The ten-measure sentence contains two elements: m. [-4 and m. 5-10.\nThese are repeated in reverse order, with slight variations, at the end of the theme\nleading to V of vi, in lieu of a transition.\n\nOp. 14/1-1. Though short (twelve measures), this theme may be considered a\nprototype of the \u2018group\u2019 of themes. Four distinct motive formulations appear in\nsuccession.\n\nOp. 28-I. This thirty-nine-measure theme (above a tonic pedal point momentarily\ninterrupted in m. 26 and 34) begins with a ten-measure theme, which is immediately\nrepeated an octave higher. The continuation, m. 21-28, resembles the consequent of\na period in its relationship to the opening. It, too, is repeated, and extended by a varied\nrepetition of the cadence. The variations and their articulation are subtle but not far-\nreaching.\n\nEven these few examples suggest the great variety of themes: the free articulation,\nthe irregularity in the length of segments, the number of distinct motive formulations,\nthe presence or absence of internal repetitions, the range of connective possibilities\nwith what follows (sometimes definite isolation by means of strong cadences followed\nby codettas, sometimes complete merger without any break).\n\nA feeling for the full flexibility of the form can only be gained by thorough study\nof a great many examples from many composers.\n\nTHE TRANSITION\n\nNo special discussion of this feature is necessary. A considerable number of charac-\nteristic examples have been discussed in Chapter XVIII.\n\nOccasionally there is no independent transition (Op. 10/2 and Op. 10/3). But a well-\ndeveloped modulatory passage between the principal and subordinate themes be-\ncomes a valuable source of contrast in the recapitulation.\n\nBoth the transformation of the main theme into a transition, and the transition with\nan independent theme are equally useful, the choice depending in part on the amount\nof internal repetition incorporated in the principal theme.\n\nObviously, in very extended works (symphonies, concertos), the transition may\nrequire more than one theme.\n\nThe more extended transitions normally close, of course, with liquidation and\nemphasis of a suitable upbeat chord or region.\n\n",
