The a!-section contains an extended recapitula-\ntion. An enriched cadence starts in m. 22, within which, paradoxically, the end (m.\n27-30), looks like a transposition of the beginning. There follows a codetta of four\nmeasures, motivally remote, which is repeated, interchanging the position of the parts\nas in multiple counterpoint, A smaller codetta (m. 38 39), repeated and liquidated,\nbrings the movement to an end.\n\nString Quartet, Op. 18/6, Scherzo. A codetta begins in m, 30, featuring closely\nrelated motive-forms. After frequent repetitions, the rhythm is condensed to equal\neighth-notes in m. 39, which are finally liquidated into scale lines and broken\nchords.\n\nString Quartet, Op. 59/2, Allegretto. In m. 17 the harmony settles down in a way\nthat suggests the beginning of an episode, although it can also be interpreted as a kind\nof sequence of the preceding four measures. The segment, m. 21-28, repeated in m.\n29-36 (where it overlaps the beginning of the recapitulation, m. 36) possesses the\nindependence of an episode, but functions here as a remodulation (Neapolitan triad,\nfollowed by V and J). The A-section ends on VII (the subtonic of e minor). Hence, the\nrecapitulation is changed considerably and its ending reaffirmed with added codettas.\nThe last of these (m. 48-49), an augmentation of m. 47, can be considered as a written-\nout ritardando, such as performers conventionally supply to make the ending of a\npiece distinct.\n\nString Quartet, Op. 74 (Harp Quartet), Presto. In m. 17a long episode in the Nea-\npolitan region begins. Its partial repetition remodulates. The recapitulation (m. 37)\nquotes only three measures of the beginning. and continues with a liquidating form\nof m. 3 to another episode on a pedal G (m. 43). This is partly repeated on a pedal C\n{m. 51). A series of codettas follows, but the usual form of the cadence is avoided.\nOne may venture the hypothesis that this is intentional to provide an opening for the\ntransition (m. 423) which connects this movement with the last movement.\n\nSymphonies Nos. 1, 2 and 4 also exhibit extensions in the recapitulation, and codct-\ntas. The last codetta in the Scherzo of the Second Symphony is augmented, like a\nritardando.\n\nSymphony No. 3, Scherzo. The recapitulation, besides an extension, has a very\nlong coda section (beginning in m. 115) comprising fifty-two measures, which\nelaborates and liquidates two codetta-like segments.\n\nBrahms, Sextet, Op. 18, Scherzo. In the recapitulation, the twelve measures of the\nA-section are extended to eighteen by stubbornly repeating a circumscribing figure\nwhile the harmony changes below it.\n\nBrahms, Sextet, Op. 36, Scherzo. The subdominant flavour of the a-section perhaps\naccounts for the deceptive use of a long ostinato around the G (4), and the false\n\n7 eww rvvrrwrwrwyYrTfwewrwyTrtwT,Y\n\nTHE SCHERZO 157\n\nrecapitulation beginning in m. 56 or 57. The real recapitulation (m. 69) is introduced\nby the very remote minor triad on F\u00a5. It is concluded by three groups of codettas.\n\nTHE CODA\n\nIn larger forms even a considerable number of codettas may not be sufficient to\ncounterbalance all the preceding harmonic movement. Though this is seldom the case\nin the scherzo, nevertheless short coda sections arc often found in classical scherzos.\nThey consist of a number of codettas or codctta-like segments, occasionally modu-\nlatory, but always returning to the tonic. Generally, the later ones are progressively\nshortened, in a liquidating manner, even to the smallest residues.\n\nA more detailed discussion will be found in Chapter XVIII.\n\nTHE TRIO\n\nThe relation between scherzo and trio is the same as that between minuet and trio.\n\nIn many cases, the repetition of the scherzo follows a complete ending of the trio.\nIn other cases the recapitulation of the trio is liquidated into a transition, introducing\nan upbeat chord for the repetition of the scherzo (Op. 2/3; String Quartet, Op. 18/1;\nFifth Symphony, m. 224-35), Often a little segment may be inserted between trio and\nscherzo. In Op. 26 and the String Quartet, Op. 18/2, the motive of the scherzo is\nreintroduced on modulatory harmony. A similar segment in Beethoven's Seventh\nSymphony (m. 221-234) sounds like a little reminiscence of the trio. In the last two\nmeasures (m. 235 -6) a transposition of the motive reintroduces F.\n\nThe little segment in tonic minor in the String Quartet, Op. 18/6 (m. 65-68) is a\npeculiar way of producing a slight contrast between the trio and scherzo, both in Bb\nmajor. It is questionable whether this contrast of tonality is adequate, but recognition\nof the need for such contrast is important.\n\nThe Scherzo of Brahms\u2019s Second Sextet, Op. 36, presents an extraordinary example\nof mediation between two apparently heterogencous themes, In m. 227, twenty-four\nmeasures before the repetition of the scherzo in 2/4, a segment of eight measures\nappears (Ex. 123@), whose foresentence is a reduction of the preceding measures,\nwhich conclude the recapitulation of the trio (Ex. 1235). The analysis shows the\nderivation of m. 5--8 from the trio melody; while m. 1-4 distinctly prepare for the\nfirst phrase of the scherzo. Moreover, the construction of m. 1-4, in twos and fours,\nmay be considered a preparation for the return of 2/4. The passage ends in a written-\nout ritardando, using the first notes of the ensuing scherzo.\n\nScherzo movements are often enlarged to the dimensions of a rondo. In the String\nQuartets, Op. 74 and Op. 95, and Symphonies 4 and 7, Beethoven interpolates the\ntrio twice, alternating with three appearances of the scherzo. Schumann, in extension\nof this idea, introduces two different trios (Piano Quintet, Op. 44).\n",
