Work on it continued intermittently from\n1937 until 1948. At the time of his death most of the text had undergone four more or\nless complete revisions. During these years hundreds of special examples were written\nto illustrate the text. In the final version a great many of them were replaced by\nanalyses of illustrations from musical literature, and many others were transferred\nto Structural Functions of Harmony.\n\nSince I had worked with Schoenberg on the book throughout the entire period,\nMrs. Schoenberg asked me to assume the task of reconciling the various versions and\npreparing it for publication. The text was substantially complete up to and including\nthe chapter on \u2018Rondo Forms\u2019; only revision of the English and elimination of\nsome duplications were necessary. The final chapter was incomplete and required re-\norganization because much of its content had been anticipated in the earlier chapter\non \u2018The Parts of Larger Forms\u2019.\n\nFrom the very beginning the book was conceived in English, rather than in Schoen-\nberg\u2019s native German. This created many problems of terminology and language\nstructure. He rejected much of the traditional terminology in both languages, choos-\ning, instead, to borrow or invent new terms. For example, a whole hierarchy of terms\nwas developed to differentiate the subdivisions of a piece. Part is used non-restrictively\nas a general term. Other terms, in approximate order of size or complexity, include:\nmotive, unit, element, phrase, fore-sentence, after-sentence, segment, section and\ndivision, These terms are used consistently and their meanings are self-evident. Other\nspecial terms are explained in the text. I have chosen to keep some of the flavour of\nSchoenberg's English construction, when it is expressively effective, even though\nit may be at variance with the idiomatic.\n\nThe aim of this book is to provide a basic text for undergraduate work in com-\nposition. Thus the first half is devoted to detailed treatment of the technical problems\nwhich face the beginner. It is intended to be thoroughly practical, though each recom-\nmendation and each process described has been carefully verified by analysis of the\npractice of master composers. From this point on, the basic concepts, structures and\n\n1 Arnold Schoenberg, Structural Functions of Harmony. New York: Williams & Norgate, London, 1954.\n\n",
