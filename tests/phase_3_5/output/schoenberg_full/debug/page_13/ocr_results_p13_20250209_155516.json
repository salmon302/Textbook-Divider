  "text_content": "4 CONSTRUCTION OF THEMES\n\nmay be considered the average; in simple metres a length of four measures is normal.\nBut in very slow tempos the phrase may be reduced to half a measure; and in very\nrapid tempos eight measures or more may constitute a single phrase.\n\nThe phrase is seldom an exact multiple of the measure length; it usually varies by\na beat or more. And nearly always the phrase crosses the metrical subdivisions, rather\nthan filling the measures completely.\n\nThere is no intrinsic reason for a phrase to be restricted to an even number. But the\nconsequences of irregularity are so far reaching that discussion of such cases will be\nreserved for Chapter XIV.\n\nCOMMENT ON EXAMPLES!\n\nIn the early stages a composer\u2019s invention seldom flows freely. The control of\nmelodic, rhythmic and harmonic factors impedes the spontaneous conception of\nmusical ideas. It is possible to stimulate the inventive faculties and acquire technical\nfacility by making a great many sketches of phrases based on a predetermined har-\nmony. At first, such attempts may be stiff and awkward, but, with patience, the\nco-ordination of the various elements will rapidly become smoother, until real\nfluency and even expressiveness is attained.\n\nExs. 5-11 may be taken as an outline for practise. Here a single harmony, the tonic\nof F major, is taken as a basis. Ex. 5 shows a few of the contours which can be created\nby various arrangements of the notes of the chord. Jn Ex. 6 smaller note-values pro-\nduce different results. Ex. 7, still confined to notes of the chord, illustrates the variety\nthat can be achieved by combining different note-values (study also Exs. 2d, e, 4).\n\nExs. 8 and 9, based on Exs. 5 and 7, show how the simplest melodic and rhythmic\nadditions can contribute fluency and vitality (study also Exs. 2 and 3).\n\nThe more elaborate embellishments of Exs. 10 and 11 contribute flexibility and\nrichness of detail, but tend to overburden the melody with small notes and obscure\nthe harmony.\n\n1 The examples will come at the ends of chapters following the \u2018Comment on Examples\u2019.\n\nTHE PHRASE 5\n\na) Op.27/2-II b) Op.28-11 c) String Qoartet,Op.16/1-I\n\ng) Becthoven, Symphony No.9-1\n\nh) Bruckner, Symphony No.7-J\n\nv,ewrvrrvvwewr eee eee wh Tw Eee ee lr hh Th hh hh hh rhc thc Tl Tl hl hc OO He we we wees Vos ese ees\n",
