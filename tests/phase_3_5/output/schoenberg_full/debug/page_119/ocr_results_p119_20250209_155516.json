The following description of Fundamentals of Musical C omposition represents\nSchoenberg\u2019s first formulation of the aims, contents and methods of this book. It was included\n\nin a letter that he sent to Professor Douglas Moore of Columbia University on 16 April\n1938.)\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF MUSICAL COMPOSITION\nThe principal aim of this textbook is:\n\n(1) in first order, to provide for the average student of the universities, who has no special\ntalent for composing or for music at all;\n\n(2) to widen the horizon of the teachers (of this and other continents);\n\n(3) to offer, at the same time, everything to the talented musician, and even to him who\nlater might become a composer.\n\nThis will be made possible by the circumstance that every technical matter is discussed in\na very fundamental way, so that, at the same time, it is both simple and thorough.\n\nI have not decided definitely whether this will be done by printing the advice and the\nexamples in much smailer size or by adding a \u2018second part\u2019 which gives \u2018further advice\u2019 to\nboth the average student and the talented one. This will soon be done when I go over the\nwhole for the first time. I incline more to the idea of this second part, because it would better\nrestrict the part for the average student to the necessary minimum and one would not be\nafraid to extend the additions so that they really become of value to a future composer.\n\nThere will be discussed the usual musical forms: sentences, periods, three-part song form,\nmenuetto, scherzo, theme with variations, the various rondo-forms and sonata.\n\nThere will be explained, and advice given (among others) for such technical details as:\nhow to build motives, phrases, half-sentences, sentences, periods; the use of harmony as basis\nand backbone of all formal purposes; stable, solid forms and loose construction; transition,\nmodulation, subsidiary themes, codettas and codas, and, especially, the elaboration. One of\nthe most important matters: harmonic variation.\n\nFor the construction of themes and melodies advice is given by discussing how to vary\nmotives and phrases; ways are shown how to join the various motives to build units. For\nvariations, advice is given by showing, in a very rich manner, numerous ways of circum-\nscribing, of figuration, of development of the rhythm and of the harmony (systematically).\n\nThere are special articles on: Manners of Accompaniment, Use of Counterpoint in the\nHomophony, Character and Mood, Monotony and Contrast, Coherence, Even and Uneven\n\nAPPENDIX 215\n\nTo illustrate how this will be carried out I will mention, in place of further details, only one\nof these cases:\n\nWhen the scherzo is discussed the student is asked either to compose by himself (according\nto advice) a theme, or to use a motive from a composition by a master. The example now\nbrings a scherzo theme built with the usc of a motive from an adagio by Beethoven. This is\none point. And now, to build the second part\u2014the elaboration\u2014there follow examples of \u2018how\nto draw from one\u2019s theme\u2019. There are given twenty different patterns (four measures each)\nto show: how the basic motives can be transformed; on which degree one can start and end;\nhow the pattern can provide for the following sequence; how the harmony can behave (the\nsequence is added in different ways). And now follow twelve examples showing different ways\nof continuation after the sequence, including the liquidation of the elaborated motives and\nthe retransition to the recapitulation.\n\nI think this method is.perhaps the most outstanding feature of the whole book, pedagogi-\ncally. In my three years\u2019 contact with university students (I had to change many of my ideas\nwhich I developed within almost forty years of teaching) I have realized that the greatest\ndifficulty for the students is to find out how they could compose without being inspired. The\nanswer is: it is impossible. But as they have to do it, nevertheless, advice has to be given.\nAnd it seems to me the only way to help is if one shows that there are many possibilities of\nsolving problems, not only one. This method of showing always a great number of methods\nof solving problems and explaining them systematically is carried out through the whole\nbook on every point where it is necessary.\n\nConsidering the great number of subjects and, especially, of examples, one might expect\nthat the book will become too voluminous. But it seems that it could be kept within a normal\nsize if one uses such types which are used in new music editions and if one uses a form of paper\nwhich corresponds better to a textbook on music than used hitherto. But in no case will it\nsurpass by very much the customary extent of books on this subject.\n\nARNOLD SCHOENBERG\n\nStructures, Climax, Melody and Theme. $\n\n\u00bb\n\nA special feature of this book will be the examples and the assignments for the student. 5\n4\n\nm,\n\nas ,\n\n_ - >t T FEF eee eS\n\n",
