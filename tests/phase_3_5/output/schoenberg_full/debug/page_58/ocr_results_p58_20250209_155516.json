The differences in\ncharacter manifest themselves not only in the thematic material of the openings, but\nalso in the nature of the continuations. Compare the respective subordinate themes:\nOp. 27/2-III, m. 21 ff.; Op. 31/2-I, m. 41 ff.; Op. 57-1, m. 35 ff.\n\nHow little the tempo alone contributes to character will be realized if one compares\nthese three with three others in rapid tempo: the Presto Agitato of Op. 27/2-III with\nthe Allegro Vivace of Op. 31/1-I; or the Allegro of Op. 31/2-I with the Allegro of\nOp. 31/3-I; or the Assai Allegro of Op. 57-I with the Presto alla Tedesca of Op. 79-1.\n\nBut the changes of character within a single movement\u2014even within its smaller\nsections\u2014are even more important. Apart from the strong contrast between principal\nand subordinate themes in Op. 57-I, there are many other contrasts. Note the sudden\nchange of texture in m. 24, its intensification in m. 28 ff., and its gradual liquidation,\nm. 31 ff. How dramatic is the change of expression when \u2018dolce legato\u2019, m. 35,\nreplaces the previous hard staccato of the left hand; and when the movement sud-\ndenly stops in m. 41. A new and even stronger contrast in texture (m. 51) changes the\nentire aspect of the rest of this section.\n\nThis is not a singular case. All good music consists of many contrasting ideas, An\nidea achieves distinctness and validity in contrast with others. Heraclitus called con-\ntrast \u2018the principle of development\u2019. Musical thinking is subject to the same dialectic\nas all other thinking.\n\nDifferences of character may have an influence on the structure, but no particular\ncharacter can be said to demand a particular form. Though one would scarcely write\na waltz in the form of a symphony, Beethoven wrote the first movement of a sonata\n(Op. 54) \u2018In tempo d\u2019un Menuetto\u2019; and his Seventh Symphony, because of its charac-\nter, is commonly called the \u2018Dance Symphony\u2019. But, in general, light, graceful, simple\nmoods will not require complicated forms nor adventurous elaboration. On the other\nhand, profound ideas, deeply moving emotions, heroic attitudes, require the bold\ncontrasts and thorough elaboration of more complex forms.\n\nDescriptive music\u2014such as programme music; stage, ballet and moving picture\nmusic: melodramas; and even songs\u2014under pressure of strong and sudden contrasts,\ndevelops its forms in harmony with those emotions, events and actions which it is\nsupposed to illustrate. In such cases the basic motive itself possesses a descriptive\ncharacter or mood as illustrated in Ex. 68.\n\nIn the second movement of Beethoven\u2019s Pastorale Symphony (Ex. 68a), the sound\n\nCHARACTER AND MOOD 95\n\nof the murmuring brook is illustrated by the flowing movement of the accompani-\nment. Ex. 685, the Magic Fire Music from Wagner\u2019s Die Walkiire, expresses musically\nthe flickering flames. With an equally rich movement, Smetana describes the source\nof the River Moldau (Ex. 68c). Bach\u2019s St. Matthew Passion is rich in illustrative pas-\nsages. Among them, particularly striking because it appears in a recitative, is the\ndescription of the rending of the curtain (Ex. 68d). The swing of the weathervane is\ndepicted in Schubert\u2019s The Weathervane, and characteristically enough, the trills in\nm. 4 and 5 represent its creaking (Ex. 68e).\n\nIn composing even the smallest exercises, the student should never fail to keep in\nmind a special character. A poem, a story, a play or a moving picture may provide the\nstimulus to express definite moods. The pieces which he composes should differ widely.\nEspecially fruitful are differences in tempo, rhythm and metre. Such practice will help\nhim to acquire the capacity to produce the manifold types of contrast necessary for\nlarger forms.\n\n",
