The a-section\nestablishes a tonic; the B-section contraposes another region (one of the more closely\nrelated). This provides both contrast and coherence.\n\nFurther coherence is furnished by the metre, and by using forms of the basic motive\nwhich are not too remote from those of the a-section.\n\nFurther contrast can be achieved through the use of new variations of the basic\nmotive, or change in the order of previous motive-forms.\n\nIllustrations from the literature: Beethoven, piano sonatas\n\nThe opening of the Adagio of Beethoven's Op. 2/1, m. 1-16, reveals a structure\nfrom which a practice form can be abstracted. Its a-section, a period with a caesura\non Vinm. 4, comprises eight measures. The A}-section is condensed to four measures\n(m. 13-16). The B-section its the simplest possible model of an effective contrast. It\ncomprises four measures, built from a two-measure phrase and a varied repetition of\nit. This construction, two units, the second a more or less varied repetition of the\nfirst, possesses an obvious natural logic. The mere interchange of V and I in the B-sec-\ntion is a coherent contrast to the interchange of | and V at the beginning. The pedal\npoint on V, stationary in contrast to the moving bass of the a-section, suggests the\ncontraposition of the dominant region to the tonic region. Additional connecting\nelements are the dotted rhythm of the upbeat, the frequent use of the suspension and\nthe increasing sixteenth notes.\n\nOp. 2/2-IV (m. I-16) is another illustration of the practice form. The contrasting\nmiddle section is again on a pedal. The repetition of the two-measure unit is a slight\nvariation.\n\nIn Op. 2/2-II (m. 1-19), the two-measure unit of the B-section (m. 9-12) is only\nslightly concealed by the imitation in the left hand. Otherwise, this case differs from\nthe others only in the length of the recapitulation.\n\nIn all three, and in many of the following, the B-section ends on V, as an \u2018upbeat\nchord\u2019, and a small figure serves as a connective to the recapitulation.\n\nIn Op. 7-If the B-section and the a!-section are longer than in the practice form.\nThe length of the contrasting middle section is six measures (m. 9-14). This pro-\nlongation arises from a double repetition of its opening phrase, m. 9-10. The omission\nof one of the three units would reduce it to the four measures of the practice form.\nCuriously enough, any one of the three could equally well be omitted.\n\nIn the Rondo, Op. 2/2-IV, there is a second ternary form, the sections of which\nagain deviate in length from the practice form. The a-section is ten measures, from the\nrepeat mark in m. 57 to m. 66; the middle section is eight measures, m. 67-74. With\n\n~~ 7 3T wT vrrvrvwTFrTyTyYTYTy?F\n\nTHE SMALL TERNARY FORM 121\n\nthe exception of the cadence, the B-section consists of a series of imitations of a two-\nmeasure unit, progressing along a circle of fourths.\n\nThe Rondo, Op. 7-IV, begins with the dominant harmony; the B-section, m. 9, can\naccordingly begin with the tonic. The contour of the A-section is essentially a descend-\ning scale line, which provokes ascending scale lines in the continuation.\n\nThe contrasting middle section of Op. 14/2-II consists again of a two-measure unit\nfollowed by a varied repetition. The relation to the A-section lies in the phrasing, while\nthe contrast is emphasized by the legato style.\n\nIn Op. 26-I each section is double the usual length, and the middle section is even\nfurther extended. It consists of a sequentially repeated two-measure unit (m. 17-18),\nfollowed by a cadence. A deceptive progression (m. 24) produces the prolongation.\n\nOp. 27/1-HE. The \u2018con espressione\u2019 of the Adagio movement of this \u2018Sonata Quasi\nuna Fantasia\u2019 is justified even by its construction. One might be inclined to question\nthe coherence of the syncopations in m. 13.16. The syncopations in m. 9 are obviously\na development of those in m. 6 and 7. But those in m. 13-16 present a special piano\nstyle, a variant of the more usual form in which the harmony, not the melody, is\nsyncopated. This melodic outburst is not solely the result of exuberance. A great\ncomposer\u2019s imagination is not exhausted when he reaches the vicinity of a cadence.\nOn the contrary, it often starts to bloom here, where lesser composers are happy to\nhave arrived at a point where they can end. Ex. 101 illustrates that there was no formal\nnecessity for the prolongation; a slight change in measure 12 would have made it\npossible to eliminate m. 13-16 entirely.\n\nOp. 28-II. The contrasting middle section comprises eight measures, dwelling on\nthe dominant. It consists of a pedal point on V, above which each reappearance of\nV is introduced by H. The section is prolonged by the progressively condensed repeti-\ntion of measure 12, and an unaccompanied connective.\n\nOp. 31/1-IH. The middle section (m. 9-16) consists of the four measure-segment,\nm. 9-12, which is strictly repeated. Here the contrasting section starts with a pedal\npoint on the tonic, and ends also on the tonic. This somewhat unusual procedure\nderives from the fact that the a-section (m. 1-8) and the recapitulation (m. 17-24)\nstand upon dominant pedal points. Thus the tonic offers sufficient contrast. The\nusual I-V relation between these two sections is reversed.\n\nIllustrations from the literature; Haydn, Mozart, Schubert\u00ae\n\nHaydn, Piano Sonata No. 35, Ex. 102a. The construction of the nine-measure\nmiddle section (m. 9-17) is interesting in that it consists of 2+4+2+4-1. The opening\ntwo-measure phrase (m. 9-10) is repeated (m. 11), sequenced (m. 12), varied (m. 13)\nand concluded with element \u2018b\u2019 (m. 14). The overlapping treatment produces a four-\n\n* Most of these examples were selected because they differ, in all three sections, from the scheme of the\nPractice form, thus indicating the great varicty which is possible, even within so simple a basic structure.\n\n~~. eee ee ee eee ee ee eee eR ee re Rw\n~ eer ow3wwwe eee ey eee ee ee ee ee eee Ke ee ee ee ee eee ee er RH eer wr!
