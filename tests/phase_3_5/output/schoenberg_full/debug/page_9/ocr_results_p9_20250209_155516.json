In this basic text there is little reference to music since 1900,\nthough the student is encouraged to make full use of the resources available up to\nthat time. Nevertheless, the principles stated here can be readily applied to a variety\nof styles and to contemporary musical materials. Certain aesthetic essentials, such as\nclarity of statement, contrast, repetition, balance, variation, elaboration, proportion,\nconnexion, transition\u2014these and many others are applicable regardless of style or\nidiom.\n\nWhile primarily a textbook on composition, it will be evident that this volume can\nbe used equally well as a text in musical analysis. As such, it emphasizes the composer\u2019s\ninsight into musical organization; it is not a mere vocabulary of formal types. The\nexamples are deliberately chosen to illustrate a wide variety of departures from the\nfictitious \u2018norm\u2019. Only acquaintance with a wide range of possibilities gives the student\nenough freedom to meet the unique problems which each individual composition\nposes.\n\nTo simplify the student\u2019s analytical problems and reduce the number of lengthy\nmusical examples, most of the references to musical literature are confined to the\nBeethoven piano sonatas. The first volume of the sonatas, at least, must be considered\na required supplement. In later chapter$ references are broadened to include works\nof other composers which are readily available in miniature scores,\n\nIt was a privilege and a deeply rewarding educational experience to have worked\nwith Schoenberg over these many years on the preparation of this book. I have tried,\nin preparing this final version, to secure the clear and faithful presentation of the ideas\nwhich grew and matured during his experience with American composition students,\nideas which were verified by a broad and intensive study of musical literature. All his\nlife Schoenberg laboured to share with his students his knowledge of music. I hope\nthat through this, his last theoretical work on composition, another generation of\nstudents may share his inspiration.\n\nGERALD STRANG, 1965\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nALL citations of musical literature which do not specify the composer refer to works by\nBeethoven. If the title is not specified the reference is to his piano sonatas. Opus number and\nmovement are specified thus: Op. 2/2-III means Beethoven, Piano Sonata, Opus 2, No. 2,\nthird movement.\n\nMeasure numbers are specified from the first accented beat of the passage, even though a\npreceding upbeat is a part of the phrase.\n\nIn numbering measures the first fi! measure is numbered one. Where there are alternative\nendings the second ending starts with the same measure number as the first ending, with an\nadded subscript, e.g. Op. 2/2-I, in which the first ending contains m. 114-17. The second\nending accordingly begins with m. 114a, 115a, 116@ and 117a. M. 118-21 complete the\nsecond ending. The double bar lies within m. 121; hence, the first full measure after the double\nbar is m. 122.\n\nKeys or tonalities are represented by capital or smail letters to indicate major or minor:\na means a minor key on A; F\u00a5 means a major key on F%. Keys reached by modulation are\noften paired with the Roman numeral indicating the relation of the tonic chord to that of the\nprincipal key: from C, modulation might lead to G (V), e (iii), Ab (pV), \u00a3 (iv), ete.\n\nThe Roman numerals representing chords also reflect chord quality: I is major; vi is\nminor, etc. Substitute, or chromatic, harmonies, are often distinguished from the diatonic\nequivalent by a bar through the middle: #4 means a major chord on the third degree sub-\nstituted for the diatonic minor chord. This same chord in a different context might be re-\nferred to as V of vi, i.e. the dominant normally resolving to vi, as in the key of the relative\nminor.\n\nThe distinction between a transient modulation and chromatic harmony is always\ntenuous. In general, only firmly established modulations lead to analysis in terms of a\ndifferent key. However, when a chromatic passage remains temporarily among chords\nassociated with another key, the term region is used. Thus a reference to the tonic minor\nregion, or subdominant minor region, indicates temporary use of chords derived from the\ncorresponding key, but without fully establishing the new key by a cadence.\n\nThe following abbreviations are used throughout the book:\n\nVar(s). = variation(s)\nEx(s). = example(s)\n\n* For further explanation of region and modulation, see Schoenberg, Structural Functions of Harmony,\nChapter IT,\n\n",
