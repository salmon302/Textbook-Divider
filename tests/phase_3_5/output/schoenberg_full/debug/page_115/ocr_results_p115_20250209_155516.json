Beyond these recommendations only the composer\u2019s\nimagination and inventiveness can determine the events of the subordinate group.\n\nTHE ELABORATION (Durchfthrung)\n\nIt has been pointed out (pp. 200 ff.) that the elaboration is essentially a contrasting\nmiddle section. Because the exposition is basically stable, the elaboration tends to be\nmodulatory. Because the exposition uses closely related keys, the elaboration usually\nincludes more remote regions. Because the exposition \u2018develops\u2019 a wealth of differing\nthemes from a basic motive, the elaboration normally makes use of variants of pre-\nviously \u2018exposed\u2019 themes, seldom evolving new musical ideas.\n\nThe relative length of the elaboration varies widely. Examples can be found where\nit is approximately half as long as the exposition (e.g. first movements: Op. 2/3;\nOp. 10/3; Schubert, String Quartet in d). In some cases it ts substantially equal to the\nexposition (first movements: Op. 2/2; Symphonies Nos. 3and 5). The length can only\nbe determined by the nature of the material and the imagination of the composer.\n\nThe importance and significance of this division was much overrated during the\nlast half of the nineteenth century.\n\nTechnically, the elaboration resembles the Durchfiihrung of the scherzo (Chapter\nXVI). It consists of a number of segments, passing systematically through a number\nof contrasting keys or regions. It ends with the establishment of an appropriate\nupbeat chord or retransition, preparing for the recapitulation.\n\nThe thematic material may be drawn from the themes of the exposition in any\norder. Often a small number of features, formerly inconspicuous, dominate the entire\ndivision. Some of the segments remain for a time in a single region. Some are re-\npeated in a sequential or quasi-sequential relationship. The various sections may be\nstrongly contrasted in rhythmic features, thematic material, structure, length and\ntonality. In many elaborations the earlier segments are the longer and more stable\nones. In approaching the retransition, shorter and shorter segments, often accom-\npanied by more rapid change of region, provide both a climactic condensation and a\npartial liquidation.\n\nOccasional \u2018roving\u2019 passages, which pertain to no definite region, are interspersed\namong more stable passages, somewhat resembling transitions. Segments overlap\nfreely, the end of one coinciding with the beginning of the next. As a method of\nmaintaining musical momentum, approach chords, especially dominants, are com-\nmonly emphasized more than the tonics to which they refer. Deceptive progressions\nare also useful.\n\nMovement from region to region is usually effected through the closer key relation-\nships, though the most remote regions may be reached in the process.\u2019 There is a\n\n1 For detailed harmonic analysis of typical cases, see Schoenberg, Arnold, Structural Functions of Har-\nmony, pp. 145 ff.\n\n- > + ss vv ewe\n\nTHE SONATA-ALLEGRO 207\n\ntendency to favour regions employing more flats or fewer sharps than the principal\nkey of the movement, perhaps because the group of subordinate themes almost\nalways lies on the dominant side\u2014more sharps or fewer flats. This tendency is parti-\ncularly evident in the approach to the upbeat chord or retransition.\n\nThe beginning of the elaboration may be related to the end of the exposition in the\nsame manner as any other contrasting middle section. It may begin in the same region,\neven with the same harmony. Or another degree or region may be juxtaposed, with or\nwithout modulation. Tonic minor or major is quite common. Sometimes a kind of\ntransition is interposed, or an introductory segment.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 13-I. The structure of this elaboration is not very different from that recom-\nmended for the scherzo. After a four-measure quotation from the introduction, a\nsix-measure segment (m. 137-42) reformulated from elements of the principal theme\nand the introduction is stated in e\u00a2 (relative minor of the dominant). A sequential\nrepetition a step lower follows in m. 143. A reduced and simplified version of four\nmeasures (m. 149-52) now appears three times. Though the dominant of c is reached\nin m. 157, an extended cadential progression, liquidating most of the features of the\ntheme, intervenes before the dominant is finally confirmed in m. 167. A long passage\nensues over a pedal point on the dominant (m. 167-87), which includes two more\nreferences to the theme-form used earlier. An eighth-note descending figure (m. 187-\n94) acts as retransition.\n\nOp. 28-I. Here again the structure is essentially monothematic, and based on the\nprinciple of the sequence plus progressive reduction. The retransition at the end of\nthe exposition is diverted to the key of the subdominant (G), in which the principal\ntheme is restated (m. 167-76). A slightly modified restatement in the parallel minor\n(g) gives way to a sequence of its last four measures, a fourth lower. These eight\nmeasures (m. 183-90) are repeated with the voices interchanged as in double counter-\npoint. A reduction to four measures (m. 199-202) appears in d; it is sequenced in a.\nFurther reduction to two measures (m. 207-8) with a freer (liquidating) treatment of\nthe eighths, and to one measure (m. 211 ff.) leads to a pedal point on Ht (dominant\nof the relative minor in m. 219). Residues of the motive are reduced to a mere rhyth-\nmic reminiscence without even harmonic change (m. 240-56).\n\nAt this point the recapitulation could follow. Instead an episodic quotation of the\nclosing theme (m. 136) in B and d leads to V of D in m. 266.\n\nOp. 2/1-I. References to the principal theme appear only in the introductory mea-\nsures (m. 49-54), and in the retransition (m. 95-100). The main body of the elabora-\ntion utilizes the subordinate theme and its residues in the familiar sequential manner,\nreaching a pedal point on V in m. 81.\n\nOp. 2/2-I.
