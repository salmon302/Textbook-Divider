The modulatory scheme is:\n\nTonic minor g m. 83\nSubdominant minor c m. 91\nFlat submediant Ep m. 98\nSubdominant minor c m. 106\nUnstable m. 114\nTonic minor g m. ?21\n\nThe recapitulation (m. 132) presents slight variations of the setting. The transition\nand retransition are somewhat lengthened. The final repetition of a, which would\nordinarily occur in the vicinity of m. 205, is displaced by the insertion of a passage\nbased on the middle section of the principal theme (cf. m. 9-10). A recurs finally in\nm. 224, much expanded by means of rests and tempo changes.\n\nTt is difficult to determine whether all of the material between m. 205 and the end\nshould be classified as coda. Fortunately, the musical result is not determined by\nconformity to analytical expectations. Ambiguity is sometimes a quality to be\nrecognized, not necessarily to be explained away.\n\nOp. 22-1V. The a-section in its various appearances is subjected to a variety of\nornamental intensifications and changes of setting. The group of subordinate themes\n(m. 19-49) presents a number of distinct motive-forms in loose juxtaposition. The\nmodifications in the recapitulation are worth study, particularly the treatment of the\nbridge (m. 41-49), which anticipates the melodic figure at the beginning of the\nreturning principal theme. In the recapitulation this passage is enriched and intensified\nby the quotation of the entire first four measures, transposed to the subdominant\nregion (m, 153), The c-section (m. 72-111) begins like a trio of the \u00e9tude-like type,\nin the unusual region of f (minor v!). It gives way (m. 81) to a modulatory-contra-\npuntal group, derived from the transitional segment used to introduce both B (m.\n19-22) and c (m. 68-71). This incipient Durchfithrung is followed by a return of the\n\u00e9tude-like segment, suggesting the ordinary ternary trio structure; but the key is bb\n(tonic minor), thus continuing the modulatory process instead of returning to the\nregion of the first statement, as the normal ternary procedure would demand. This\nc-section thus combines trio character with the procedures of the modulatory middle\nsection, or Durchftihrung.\n\ncc\" - Pe FY we Fee eee\n\nXX\n\nTHE SONATA-ALLEGRO\n\n(FIRST MOVEMENT FORM)\n\nTHE concept of the SONATA implies a cycle of two or more movements of\ndiffering character. The great majority of sonatas, string quartets, symphonies\nand concertos since the time of Haydn utilize this structural principle. Contrast\nof key, tempo, metre, form and expressive character distinguish the various move-\nments. Unity is provided by key relationships (the first and last movements use\nthe same tonic, and intervening movements are related to this tonic) and through\nmotival relationships, which may be clearly evident or disguised with the utmost\nsubtlety.\n\nBefore Haydn all the movements were normally in a single tonality, sometimes\nalternating between major and parallel minor. The Viennese classic masters intro-\nduced more variety by using other related keys for the middle movements.\n\nWhile three or four movements are normal, examples ranging from two to seven\nmovements exist. The table on p. 200 indicates the wide variety to be found\namong the works of Beethoven.\n\nIn general, the first and last movements are in rapid tempo, though Op. 54 starts\n\u2018In tempo d\u2019un Menuetto\u2019, Op. 26 begins with an \u2018Andante con Variazioni\u2019 and Op.\n27/2 with an \u2018Adagio sostenuto\u2019. A short introduction in slow tempo, followed by the\ncustomary allegro, is not uncommon. The slow last movement, \u2018Adagio molto\u2019 of\nOp. 111, is a rare exception.\n\nIntervening movements fall generally into two types, slow and moderately fast.\nThe slow movements vary from Allegretto or Andantino to Adagio, Largo or\nGrave. The moderately fast movements are ordinarily stylized dance forms, e.g.\nminuets or scherzos. The latter, of course, sometimes move at an exceedingly\nrapid pace.\n\nOccasionally, one of the movements is a Theme with Variations: Op. 26-1; Op.\n14/2-I1; String Quartet, Op. 74-IV. Absence of a slow movement permits the appear-\nance of both a minuet and a scherzo in Op. 31/3.\n\nThe last movement is frequently written in one of the rondo forms. (Variations,\nlike Op. 109, or a Fugue, as in Op. 110, are exceptional.) But quite often the last move-\nment, and usually the first movement, is written in the great form which is variously\ncalled \u2018Sonata Form\u2019, \u2018Sonata\u2014Allegro\u2019, or First Movement Form.\n",
