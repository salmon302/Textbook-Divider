A sharply contrasted, rather lyrical section, derived from\nm. 9-12, now follows. Residues, rather freely articulated (m. 181-201), lead to V in\nm. 202, after which liquidation gradually clears the way for the recapitulation\n(m. 225).\n\nOp. 2/3-I. After an introductory modulation using the closing theme (m. 91), an\n\u00e9tude-like passage on unstable harmony gives way to a sudden quotation of the\nprincipal theme in D (m. 109). A pattern (m. 113-16), consisting of two sharply con-\ntrasted elements, is sequenced, following the circle of fifths, and extended to reach\nthe usual pedal point on V (m. 129). Residues of the principal theme appearing over\nthe pedal point anticipate its reappearance in the recapitulation (m. 139).\n\nOp. 10/1-I. After a short introductory reference to the principal theme (m. 106\u2014\n17), the remainder of the elaboration is built upon a theme which, at least in this form,\nis not found in the exposition, though it is certainly related to the transition theme\n(m. 32) and to the subordinate theme (m. 56). A masterly imagination and intuition\nare at work here,\n\nOp. 10/2-I. The chief motive material of this elaboration derives from the inci-\ndental octaves at the end of the exposition (m. 65-66) and the ornamental triplet\nsixteenths of the principal theme. Again the composer's imagination produces a \u2018free\nfantasia\u2019 having only the most tenuous relation to the main themes. The end of the\nelaboration does not reach the usual dominant because of the curious recapitulation\n(see p. 210) which begins in D (submediant major).\n\nMozart, String Quartet, C, K.V. 465-I. Built entirely from the initial motive-form\nof the exposition (m. 23-24), this elaboration is particularly instructive with regard\nto the use of motival transformation. Beginning (m. 107) with an imitative dialogue\nbetween violin and viola, the first segment presents a gradual expansion of the com-\npass of the motive, reaching a climax in m. 116. In the process the upbeat becomes\na broken chord, which takes over completely in m. 117, Note the transformation of\nthe dominant seventh on F into an augmented 6/5 which leads to the dominant of a.\nThe next segment starts again with the motive (m. 121), and the transformation is\ncarried further. Observe the figure of m. 122-3, in which the motive is reduced to con-\ntinuous eighths with a compass of only a third. In the continuation the motive is\nshortened to a single measure (m. 126 ff.), the upbeat again becoming a broken chord,\nwhich is liquidated in m. 128-9, The next two segments (m. 130-6, 137-46) use only\nthe shortened form. The dominant is reached in m. 145, and the original form of the\nmotive recurs briefly in the formulation which appeared in m. 121, but quickly\nevaporates into interwoven broken chords (m. 151-4).\n\nMozart, String Quartet in A, K.V. 464-I. The motival treatment here is equally\nnoteworthy, particularly with regard to the gradual reduction and liquidation which\nbegins in m. 123. Mozart\u2019s harmonic subtlety is fully evident in this elaboration. The\n\n7\" 3. ef =e reer\n\nTHE SONATA-ALLEGRO 209\n\nend of the retransition (m. 162) overlaps the beginning of the recapitulation. A still\nmore striking overlap occurs in his Symphony in g, m. 165-6.\n\nTHE RETRANSITION\n\nThe close of the elaboration must be handled in such a manner as to neutralize\nmodulatory momentum and liquidate motival obligations created within the section,\nand at the same time to prepare the listener for the return to the recapitulation. The\nreduction of motive-forms to minimum content, and the presence of relatively long\nsections stressing the dominant or some other suitable upbeat chord, have been men-\ntioned in the foregoing analyses.\n\nOften a bridging upbeat-like passage is inserted (e.g. Op. 2/3-I, m. 135; Op. 13-I,\nm. 187; Op. 14/2-I, m. 121). Since this point is the junction between two main\ndivisions, a contrast of rhythm or dynamics, or both, and of register generally\nreinforces the desired contrast.\n\nIn more complex compositions the liquidating passage over a dominant pedal point\nis replaced with a series of segments resembling codettas, except that they repeatedly\napproach the upbeat chord instead of the tonic. They may include internal modulation\nor \u2018roving\u2019 harmony which, however, returns in various ways to the upbeat chord. In\nthe Eroica Symphony-I, the dominant is reached in m. 338, some sixty measures\nbefore the recapitulation (m. 398). It recurs briefly in m. 354, and is finally established\nin m. 378 ff. A similar treatment can be found in the Fifth Symphony between m. 190\nand 248.\n\nWhen the recapitulation does not begin with the tonic, a different upbeat chord may\nbe necessary, and the customary emphasis may be curtailed or omitted (e.g. Op. 10/2-\nI, Op. 31/3-I).\n\nTHE RECAPITULATION\n\nAs in the larger rondos, the minimum change in the recapitulation is the trans-\nposition of the subordinate group to the tonic region.\n\nSince no modulation is necessary, one might expect the transition to disappear\nhere. On the contrary, its effect is usually heightened, and it is often lengthened.\nUnless the subordinate group contains modulatory elements, the transition now pro-\nvides the only contrast to the tonic region which governs the entire recapitulation and\ncoda. Thus its value as a contrast becomes more significant.\n\nA composer\u2019s artistry usually demands more than the minimum necessary changes.\nVariation, after all, is a merit in itself. Reductions, omissions, extensions and addi-\ntions, harmonic changes and modulations, changes of register and setting, contra-\npuntal treatment; even reconstruction may be applied as the composer\u2019s imagination\ndictates. Of course, the repetition must be recognizable as such, especially where the\nthemes enter. But the \u2018adventures\u2019 of the themes during the elaboration, and the\n\n",
