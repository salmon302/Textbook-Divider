This is only partly correct. For instance, Beethoven's Septet,\nOp. 20. symphonic in its first and last movements, contains both a Minuct and a\nScherzo.\n\nAny attempt to define the structure of the scherzo strictly will meet similar prob-\nlems. Beethoven seldom uses the title, Scherzo, if the movement, like that of the\nString Trio, Op. 9/3, is in minor. To this degree it is true that his scherzos may be\ncalled playful, humorous, gay. But among cight scherzos from Brahms\u2019s chamber\nmusic, five are in minor. Beethoven calls \u2018Scherzo\u2019 only two of the rapid middle\nmovements of his symphonies, Many such movements in his sonatas and string quar-\ntets are only labelled Allegro, Vivace, Presto, etc., probably because of deviations in\ncharacter, form, mode, rhythm, tempo or metre, from the strict concept that he had\nin mind. Among these movements can be found some in minor and some in metres\nother than 3/4, e.g. 3/8, 6/8, 6/4, 2/2, 4/4, 2/4, etc. The structure of the B-section also\nvaries considerably. Schubert's scherzos are mostly in triple metre, but often in minor.\n{n Brahms, Schumann and Mendelssohn one finds many different metres.\n\nWith regard to character and mood, the restriction to the playful and humorous is\nnot factual. Even the tempo is not decisive. Beethoven\u2019s own metronome indications\nfor rapid middle movements range around \u00a5. -:. 100, which is his average scherzo\ntempo. However, these middle movements, with only the rapid tempo in common,\ndiffer very widely in expressive qualities.\n\nA survey of scherzos and other rapid middle movements of Beethoven, Schubert,\nMendelssohn, Schumann, Chopin, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Berlioz, Bruckner, Mahler,\nReger, Debussy, Ravel, etc., reveals such characters as: vivacious, sparkling, brilliant,\nwitty, enthusiastic, ecstatic, ardent, fiery, energetic, vehement, impassioned, dramatic,\ntragic, heroic, gigantesque, diabolical, grotesque.\n\nThe scherzo is distinctly an instrumental piece, characterized by rhythmical\naccentuations, and rapid tempo. The tempo prevents frequent change of the har-\nmonies and remote variation of motive-forms.\n\nWith regard to structure, scherzos of the masters have only one thing in common:\nthey are ternary forms. They differ from smaller ternary forms and the minuet in\n\nee yvvrywrrerrrr re\n\nTHE SCHERZO 151\n\nthat the middle section is more modulatory and more thematic. In some cases, there\nis a special type of wodudatory contrasting middle section which approaches the\nelaboration (Durchfiihrung)! of the Sonata Allegro.\n\nTHE A-SECTION\n\nIn principle, the a-section does not differ from the a-sections which were previously\ndiscussed. Often the theme is double the usual number of measures on account of the\nrapid tempo. For example, the Scherzos of Op, 2/2, Op. 2/3, Op. 28, and the Second\nSymphony (Ex. 120c) begin with periods. The Scherzos of the Violin Sonata, Op. 30/2\n(Ex. 120a), the String Quartet, Op. 18/1 (Ex. 1205), and the Froica Symphony (Ex.\n121) begin with sentences.\n\nThe character of the last of these has had great influence as the model for many\nsubsequent scherzos. Structurally (as the analysis in Ex. 12ld shows) it is a circum-\nscription of the ascending tonic and the descending dominant (Exs. 1214, c). This\nskeleton is clothed with auxiliaries and passing notes. The relation between this theme\nand those of the first and fourth movements (Exs. 121d, e) is strong evidence in favour\nof the concept of \u2018monothematicism\u2019 in a cyclic work,\n\nTHE MODULATORY CONTRASTING MIDDLE SECTION\n\nThe main function of the B-section is to provide contrast. It is generally held that\nthe B-section of a scherzo should be an elaboration (Durchfiihrung). But in fact it often\nresembles the B-section of the minuet, while many minuets possess a modulatory\ncontrast.\n\nThe a-section, over relatively stable harmony, exposes its motive-forms in various\naspects. In the modulatory middle section, changes of shape and even of constitution\noccur as this same material passes through fluctuating, unstable harmonic situations.\nThis freedom of structure and motive treatment does not tmply that regularity, logic\nand balance can be ignored.\n\nAgain, it is advisable to become acquainted with this new type of contrast through\na practice form, which, like all abstractions, differs from reality, and replaces freedom\nwith guiding restrictions.\n\nTHE PRACTICE FORM\n\nThe modulation must be organized to promote intelligibility. Thercfore, it should\nproceed, not in one great leap, but gradually, according to a plan which provides for\n\n1! The terms \u2018elaboration\u2019 and Durehftihrung are used interchangeably throughout this book to refer to the\ntechnique odinarily called \u2018development\u2019, and to the sections of larger forms which make extensive use of\nthis technique. Schoenberg rejected the more usual term on the grounds that littke development (in the sense\nof growth, maturation, evolution) takes place in the material used. Motive-forms are adapted, varied, cx-\npanded, condensed, recombined and carried through various keys or regions; but they seldom grow or\nevolve into a \u2018more mature or advanced state\u2019 (Ed.).\n",
