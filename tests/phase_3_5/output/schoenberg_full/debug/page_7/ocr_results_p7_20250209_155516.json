Like the two other books, Structural Functions of Harmony\n(Williams & Norgate, 1954) and Preliminary Exercises in Counterpoint (Faber &\nFaber, 1963), this one was intended for \u2018the average student of the universities\u2019 as well\nas for the talented student who might become a composer (see Schoenberg's statement\nin the Appendix). As the author states, it was planned as a book of \u2018technical\nmatters discussed in a very fundamental way\u2019.\n\nFundamentals of Musical Composition combines two methods of approach: (1) the\nanalysis of masterworks, with special emphasis on the Beethoven piano sonatas; and\n(2) practice in the writing of musical forms, both small and large. As a book of\nanalysis it amplifies much in the later chapters of Structural Functions of Harmony,\nparticularly Chapter XI, \u2018Progressions for Various Compositional Purposes\u2019. As a\nmethod for preliminary exercises in composition it enlarges the material of the syllabus,\nModels for Beginners in Composition (G. Schirmer, Inc., 1942).\n\nIn Fundamentals of Musical Composition, as in ali of his manuals of musical\npractice dating back to his Harmonielehre (Universal Edition, 1911; abridged English\ntranslation, Theory of Harmony, Philosophical Library, 1948), Schoenberg's main\npedagogical approach is not just one of theoretical speculation\u2014although one will\nalways find a basic theoretical foundation underlying his practical advice\u2014but of\nexposing fundamental technical problems in composition and of showing how they\nmight be solved in a number of ways. Through such an approach the student is\n\nencouraged to develop his own critical judgement based on the evaluation of many\npossibilities.\n\nLEONARD STEIN, 1965\n\n",
