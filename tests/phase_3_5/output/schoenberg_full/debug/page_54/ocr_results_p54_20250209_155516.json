In m. 48-55 both\nupper voices are so well organized that it is difficult to say which is main voice and\nwhich is countermelody. In the continuation (m. 56-85), the bass moves more\nmelodically than the presentation of the harmony would require, without, however,\nbecoming a countermelody.\n\nThe lowest voice in Op. 14/2-I, m. 49 ff., imitates quasi-contrapuntally only the\nphrasing of the melody. Similarly, the auxiliaries in Op. 31/1-II, m. 16 ff., though dis-\nguised as imitations, embellish sustained tones of the harmony. The imitations of\nOp. 28-IV, m. 28-31 and 33-35, are definitely not contrapuntal, since they present\nonly one harmony.\n\nTREATMENT OF THE BASS LINE\n\nExcept in the case of a pedal point, the bass should participate in every change of\nthe harmony. One must not forget that the bass should be treated like a secondary\nmelody, which means that it should remain (except for special purposes) within a\nsingle register and possess a certain degree of continuity (Exs. 44g, i, j, k, 45i, 46u,\n51b). The ear is trained to pay much attention to the bass. Even a short note is under-\nstood as a continuing bass until another bass note can be heard as a (melodic)\ncontinuation.\n\nFor the sake of fluency a bass which is not countermelodic should make free use\nof inversions, even where they are not harmonically necessary (Exs. 45g, 46c, g, 51f,\n58d, 59g).\n\nTREATMENT OF THE MOTIVE OF THE ACCOMPANIMENT\n\n{n many cases a single motive of accompaniment is used consistently throughout\na whole section, except for cadences. This is possible only in the most primitive cases,\nin which the harmony does not change much, and the motive is readily adaptable\n(e.g. the obsolete Alberti bass).\n\nChanges of character or construction, or increase in the number of harmonies, may\njustify or even require modification of the accompaniment. A clear change in all these\nrespects is found in Op. 14/2-1; compare m. 1-4 with m. 5 ff. In Op. 31/1-II, where the\nclimactic ascension in the melody requires richer harmony, the motive of accompani-\nment is modified accordingly (m. 5). In Op. 31/3-III, the special form of the broken\nchord figure is reduced (m. 3 ff.) to no more than is necessary to keep up the motus.\n\nThe motive of the accompaniment, as a unifying device, should be maintained for\nat least several measures or phrases. Even if varied, it should not disappear completely.\nBut cases exist in which more than one figure is used, especially in Mozart's Rococo\nstyle, as many of the excerpts in Exs. 45 and 59 prove.\n\nHarmonic requirements in the vicinity of cadences or half cadences often force\nmodification or liquidation of the motive of accompaniment. This process may take\n\nTHE ACCOMPANIMENT 87\n\na variety of forms. See, for instance, Exs. 45f, 46/, 48c, 5la, 55a, b, 56b, 58e, 59g,\nh, 61d.\n\nREQUIREMENTS OF INSTRUMENTS\n\nIn piano writing the necessity of keeping the accompaniment within reach of the\nfingers sometimes requires co-operation of both hands (Op. 2/3-I, m. 141 ff.; Op.\n13-II, m. 41-42 ff.) or a shift from hand to hand\u2014with or without a change of\nregister (Op. 27/2-I, m. 15-16, 23-24; Op. 31/2-I, m. 28 ff.). Changes of register also\ntake place for reasons of expressiveness or sonority.\n\nIn writing for other than keyboard instruments, the individual parts should be\nelaborated more independently, in order to sustain the interest of the players. But\nthere is danger of imbalance produced by too rich an accompaniment. Economy and\ntransparency are indispensable.\n\nThe variety of chamber-music combinations precludes detailed discussion of the\n\naccompaniment. But, intelligently applied, the principles are the same as for keyboard\ninstruments.\n\n",
