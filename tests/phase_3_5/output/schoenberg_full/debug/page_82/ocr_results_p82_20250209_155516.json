Both tempi are extreme, even for Beethoven. Most of his other\nminuets, and those of Mozart and Haydn, average about J. -= 60-70, though some\nare as slow as -J. \u2014 40-50. Accordingly, more small note values (eighths and six-\nteenths) appear in the minuet, and the harmony changes more frequently than in the\nscherzo. In other dance forms, the harmony often remains unchanged for a number of\nmeasures; in the minuet the harmony seldom lasts longer than one or two measures,\nand often there are two or more harmonies within a measure.\n\nThe character of a minuet may range from the unpretentiously singable (e.g.\nBeethoven, Op. 31/3-II]) to the stubbornly insistent (Mozart, Symphony No. 40 in\n\ng-minor); but in general the character, like the tempo, is moderate.\n\nAs the minuet was the favoured dance of the courts in the eighteenth century, it\ndid not call for so much accentuation of the rhythm as did the more popular dances.\nAccordingly, the conventional accompaniments (cf. Ex. 65) were probably never\nmuch used. If some vestiges of them appear, they are generally stylized.\n\nTHE FORM\n\nThe minuet is an a-B-A! form, quite similar to the small ternary form. A practice\nform derived from it need not deviate from this a-B-a!. However, the fact that the\nB-section must, because of the customary repetition marks (||: A: |: B A!: jl), follow first\nthe A-section and then the A!-section, has to be taken into consideration. Ex. 113, by\nBach, is an illustration of the simple minuet, and corresponds quite closely to the\npractice form.\n\nMany minuets in the fJiterature differ from the practice form. There are structural\ndeviations in all the three parts: unequal length of phrases; sequential or other\ninternal repetitions; extensions (often provoked by deceptive progressions); or\ncodettas added to the a-section and its recapitulation. Mozart and Haydn, especially,\noften insert episodes; and even co-ordinate ideas appear, sometimes only rudimen-\ntary, but occasionally quite independent and firmly established.\n",
