Ornamental variation\u2014breaking down longer notes through the\nuse of passing notes, circumscribing notes, tone repetitions, etc.\u2014need not change the\ncontour essentially. Excessive rhythmic changes or shifts of accent are likely to prevent\nrecognition.\n\nVariation of the harmony will consist largely of insertions and substitutions. The\naccompaniment may be varied by making changes in the figuration, though such\nchanges should be less far-reaching than in the melody. Further variation can be\nproduced by contrapuntal or semi-contrapuntal methods: imitation, addition of a\ncounter melody or the melodic elaboration of subordinate voices.\n\nA changed cadence may require considerable reformulation, or even complete\nreconstruction.\n\nIn a small form, alterations should be used with discretion, maintaining a balance\nwith preceding sections.\n\nIfestrations from the literature\n\nBeethoven, Op. 2/1-IT. The recapitulation of the initial ternary form ts reduced\nto four measures. Only the first measure (m. 13) is preserved, an octave higher. M. 14\nturns at once to IV, in preparation for the cadence. Connected by the rhythm of the\nupbeat to m. 1, which was omitted in approaching m. 13, m. [5 is a figuration of a\ndescending contour resembling m. 3 and 7.\n\nOp. 2/2-II. The seven-measure recapitulation (m. 13-19) combines reduction\n(omitting m. 3-5) and extension (by adding sequentially m. 15-16). M. 17 is an\nascending reformulation of m. 6, through which the repetition of m. 7-8 (in m. 18-19)\noccurs climactically an octave higher. The sequences and the ascending contour of\nthis reconstruction lend emphasis to the upper voice, which was previously some-\nwhat obscured by the competing bass voice.\n\nOp. 2/2-IV. The recapitulation of the first ternary form (m. 1-16) is reduced to\nfour measures (m. 13-16) by melodic and harmonic condensations. In the second\nternary form (m. 57-79), the recapitulation is reduced to five measures (m. 75-79),\nwith a slight melodic variation.\n\nOp. 7-II. The recapitulation (m. 15-24) is extended to ten measures. This is\nachieved by sequences and other repetitions, condensations and the deceptive cadence\nin m. 20, which requires a second, enriched cadence.\n\nOp. 7-1V. The recapitulation (m. 13-16) repeats only the second half of the period,\nslightly varying the piano style by the addition of octaves.\n\nOp. 14/2-II. The recapitulation is reduced to four measures (m. 13-16), followed\n\n*by a codetta-like addition in the form of an enriched cadence.\n\nOp. 26-1. The recapitulation (m. 27-34) repeats only the second half (m. 9-16) of\n\nthe sixteen-measure period.\n\nTHE SMALL TERNARY FORM 125\n\nOp. 27/1, Adagio. The recapitulation (m. 17-24) repeats the entire A-section, with\nminor elaborations of the piano style, and a cadence changed to lead to the tonic.\n\nOp. 28-II. The recapitulation (m. 17-22) omits m. 3-5, and condenses m. 6-8 into\ntwo measures (m. 21-22), converting the cadence to lead to the tonic. This reduction\nis balanced by the insertion of two semi-sequential repetitions of m. 18.\n\nOp. 31/1-III. The recapitulation (m. 17-24) is noteworthy because the main melody\nis transferred to the tenor voice, while a quasi-melodically elaborated accompaniment\nis added in the right hand.!\n\nEx. 1026. The recapitulation (m. 15-24) omits the first four measures of the A-sec-\ntion. This reduction is again balanced by extending the content of the second half of\nthis period to ten measures. This extension is produced by repetition of m. 17, followed\nby a dramatic pause, thus adding two measures. After this interruption the cadential\nmeasures follow, introduced by derivatives of the preceding figure. The last three\nmeasures are a mere transposition of m. 8-10 to the tonic.\n\nEx. 102c. Discussion of the recapitulation appears on p. 122.\n\nEx. 102d. In m. 13-17 of the recapitulation only the embellishments are varied.\nThe cadence, m. 18-20, replacing the half-cadence to V with a full cadence to {,\nnaturally requires more change.\n\nEx. 102e. The recapitulation was discussed on p. 122.\n\nEx. 104. The beginning of the recapitulation (m. 13) surprisingly makes use of the\naugmented 6/5 chord (on H) of the submediant region. Here it is treated as if it were\na dominant seventh chord on IV, resolving to a diminished seventh chord derived\nfrom V. In view of the preceding cadence to the dominant of vi, it should probably\nbe understood as in Exs, 1046 and c.\n\nThe possibility that the recapitulation might begin on a different degree than the\nbeginning was mentioned on p. 123, and is illustrated in Exs. 107a, 6 and c, in\nwhich the recapitulations begin, respectively, on H, V, and 16/4. Such cases are com-\nparatively rare in the small ternary form.\n\n1 Such a voice is often miscalled a \u2018counterpoint\u2019. Real counterpoint is based on invertible combinations;\nbut in homophonic music one more often finds the semi-contrapuntal technique of providing counter-\n\nmelodies, repetition of imitative figures, etc., which vary the accompaniment to the main voice. A very\nenlightening instance is Beethoven's String Quartet, Op. 18/6, Adagio.\n\n",
