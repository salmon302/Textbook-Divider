The third part is sometimes a true repetition (recapitulation) of the first, but\noftener it is a more or less modified repetition. The second part is organized as a\ncontrast.\n\nThis form may derive from the early \u2018Rondeau\u2019, in which interludes were inserted\nbetween repetitions of a refrain. Repetition satisfies the desire to hear again what was\npleasing at first hearing, and simultaneously aids comprehension. A contrast, how-\never, is useful to avoid the possibility of monotony.\n\nSections producing contrasts of various types and degrees are to be found in a great\nmany forms: e.g. Small Ternary Form (formerly called Three-Part Song Form);\nlarger ternary forms, such as Minuet or Scherzo; and Sonata or Symphony.\n\nContrast presupposes coherence. Incoherent contrast, though tolerated in \u2018descrip-\ntive\u2019 music, is intolerable in a well organized form. Contrasting sections, therefore,\nmust utilize the same processes by which motive-forms are connected in simpler\nformulations.\n\nTHE SMALL TERNARY FORM\n\nThe a-section of the A\u2014B\u2014a! form may be a sentence or a period, ending on IJ, V or\nHH (iii) in major; on i, IIE, V, or v in minor. The beginning, at least, should clearly\nexpress the tonality, because of the contrast to follow.\n\nThe a'-section, the recapitulation, ends on the tonic if it completes an independent\npiece. It is seldom an unchanged repetition. The final cadence generally differs from\nthat of the first section, even if both lead to the same degree.\n\n",
