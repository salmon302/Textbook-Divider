It derives from the same circumstance: the\ndesire to revive the short-lived tone of the piano.\n\nSometimes more than one motive of the accompaniment appears, e.g. when the\nbass, separated from the system of the middle voices, carries out a system of its own\n(Exs. 64e, f). This procedure is frequently used in combination with rhythmicized\nchord repetitions (Ex. 65). Occasionally, the bass is systematically placed on a weak\nbeat (Exs. 65q-1).\n\nIntermittent. The harmony may appear only once in a measure, or once in several\nmeasures. It may be sustained (Op. 2/3-1, m. 97-108; Ex. 584); or a short chord may\nbe stated at the beginning of a measure (Op. 10/1 -T, m. 1-3; Op. 10/2-I, m. |-4; Exs.\n58c, f); or a short chord may occur during a rest or a sustained note of the melody\n(Op. 2/2-IIL, m. 1-2, 5-6; Ex. 46d).\n\nAfterbeat harmony, including syncopations, appears in many forms, e.g. Op. 2/t-I.\nm. 2-8, 41-46; Op. 2/2, Scherzo; Op. 14/1-1, m. 1-3.\n\nComplementary. Complementary rhythm is that relation between voices or groups\nof voices in which one voice fills out the gaps in the movement of the others, thus\nmaintaining the motus, i.e. the regular subdivision of the measure. The accompani-\nment is often added as a complement to the basic rhythm of the principal part (Op.\n14/2-I, m. 1-4, 26-27, etc.; Op. 109-1, m. 1-8; Exs. 67a, 6; Op. 2/2, Scherzo). There\nexist many hybrid cases like Op. 10/3-1V, m. 17-22; Op. 31/2-IH, especially m. 17-21;\nOp. 54-I, m. [-2-5-6. Other cases derive from semi-contrapuntal devices (Exs. 45\u00a2,\n66a, 67c).\n\nVOICE LEADING\n\nPiano style does not require strict preservation of the number of voices, as in four-\npart (chorale) harmony. If a piece starts in three or four parts, this number of parts\nwill be used rather consistently. But sometimes fewer voices are used (as if one or more\nrested) and sometimes more are used (as in the orchestra, when for a crescendo,\naccentuation, climax or other special effect, additional instruments enter).\n\nIf the basic voice-leading is free from parallel octaves, each individual voice can be\ndoubled in octaves, especially if the doubling is consistently maintained, as in Ex. 63.\nDoubling of the bass can produce variety or contrast through change of register.\nIn Ex. 45g, compare m. I-2 and 5-6 with 3-4 and 7-8; and in Ex. 46a, compare 5-8\nwith 1-4. The melody, of course, is often doubled. See, for instance, Exs. 46\u00a2e and\n60e; and Beethoven, Op. 10/1-I, m. 108 ff.; Op. 10/2-1, m. 19 ff.; Op. 14/1-T, m.\n61; Op. 26-1, Variation HI. Sometimes, even the inner voices are doubled (Exs. 660.\nc). Such doubling may appear incidentally for some special effect.\n\nContrapuntal treatment. A real contrapuntal style appears occasionally, when\nfugues or fugatos are incorporated in otherwise homophonic music. Sometimes a\n\n- 7 T Tr rr wre wr rrr we\n\nTHE ACCOMPANIMENT 85\n\nmovement begins with a fugato (Op. 10/2-II1; Mozart\u2019s String Quartet in G, Finale;\nBeethoven\u2019s String Quartet, Op. 59/3, Finale, etc.). Though such sections are often\nrepeated in a more developed form, the remainder should generally be classified as\nhomophonic.\n\nIn the elaboration division (development) of larger forms, there are frequently\nfugato episodes (Beethoven's String Quartet, Op. 59/I-I; first and fourth movements\nof his Eroica Symphony; third movement of Brahms\u2019s Piano Quintet; Beethoven,\nOp. 101, Finale; etc.).\n\nBeethoven (Op. 120, Op. 35) and Brahms (Op. 24) conclude sets of variations with\nreal fugues; and the finales of Beethoven\u2019s Sonatas, Op. 106 and Op. 110, are also\nfugues.\n\nContrapuntal episodes, generally using imitations or invertible counterpoint, are\nfrequently to be found in elaborations. See Op. 2/3-I, m. 115 ff.; Op. 22, Rondo,\nm. 81 ff.; Op. 8la-I, Coda. The canonic passage beginning the Ep section of Op. 106-!\nis unusually long.\n\nSemi- and quasi-contrapuntal treatment. While semi-counterpoint has motival and\neven thematic implications, quasi-counterpoint is often little more than a way of\nembellishing, melodizing and vitalizing otherwise unimportant voices in the harmony.\n\nSemi-counterpoint is not based on combinations such as multiple counterpoint,\ncanonic imitations, etc., but only on a free melodic movement of one or more voices,\nas in Op. 2/2-I, m. 11-16 and the imitations in m. 32 ff.; also Op. 2/3-IV, m. 57 ff.\n\nIn real homophonic music there is always one main voice; the addition of imita-\ntions, canonic or free, is principally a method of accompanying this main voice.\nOstinatos such as, for example, those in Brahms\u2019s First Symphony\u2014IV, eight mea-\nsures after \u2018E\u2019, and in the Finale of the Variations on a Theme of Haydn, may be under-\nstood similarly. Considering the bass as the main voice, this technique resembles the\nadding of voices to a \u2018cantus firmus\u2019, constantly varying the texture, as in a passa-\ncaglia.\n\nThe addition of a countermelody could also be considered a semi-contrapuntal\ndevice. See Op. 26-II, m. 45 ff.; Op. 28-1, m. 183 ff. (this passage, like Op. 10/3-1,\nm. 93-105, is in double counterpoint; but the part in eighth-notes has an embellishing\nrather than a thematic significance); Op. 31/1-III, m. 17 ff.\n\nCountermelodic phrases or fragments are often used to embellish a repetition (Op.\n10/3-II: compare m. 17-19 with 21-23) or as bridge-like fillers (Op. 13-1, m. 37 ff.)\nbetween phrases of the principal voice.\n\nMany illustrations of semi-contrapuntal treatment can be found in Exs. 54, 55 and\n56. Special attention should be paid to those cases where the harmony becomes richer\nthrough the movement of the voices; and where the motive of the accompaniment\ninvolves a characteristic rhythmic figure, often the result of a more or less free\nimitation.\n",
