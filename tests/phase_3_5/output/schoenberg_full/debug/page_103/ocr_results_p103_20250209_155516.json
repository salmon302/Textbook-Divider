The Durchfiihrung proper comes to a close on a V\nof the submediant which is affirmed over a pedal point for thirty-eight measures.\nBy contrast the real dominant is maintained for only two measures (m. 267-8).\n\nOp. 7-1 is even more extraordinary (if not unique). Remodulation plus retransition\nhere takes place in two measures (m. 187-8), and, moreover, after dwelling for a time\nin the exceedingly remote regions of a minor and d minor.\n\nOp. 2/1-1. The retransition (m. 93) differs from the first two examples only with\nrespect to the motive material which clearly anticipates the second measure of the\nprincipal theme.\n\nOp. 31/1-1.In m. 170 the syncopated rhythm in the right hand is a hint at one of the\nchief features of the theme.\n\nOp. 90-I. A sixteenth-note figure appears on the second beat of m. 130 which, in\nm. 133, is augmented to longer note values. After several additional rhythmic metamor-\nphoses, it turns out to be a preparation for the first three notes of the theme (m. 144).\n\nOp. 53-I, m. 146. The sixteenth-note figure from m. 3, over an ostinato, serves as\na preparation for the corresponding measure of the recapitulation.\n\nEroica Symphony-I. The retransition is a very dramatic case. It starts in m. 366,\non the submediant of the tonic minor (pV1), with the motive-form of m. 5, which is\nsoon liquidated and reduced to a single repeated tone. It is concluded with the famous\nentrance of the horn, which presents the tonic form of the main theme accompanied\nby the sustained dominant harmony. Wagner, who was probably right, considered it\na misprint, and had the horn play in Bb instead of Ep.\n\nOp. 13-I. The dominant is reached in m. 167 and remains as a pedal in the left hand\nup to m. 187. The frequent dynamic changes and sforzati help to make this retransition\nthe dramatic climax of the whole movement. The phrases in m. 171-4 and 179-81\nare easily recognizable anticipations of the main theme, to which the eighth-note\nfigure beginning in m. 187 is also related. The eight-measure passage, m. 187-94,\nfunctions both as a liquidation of the stormy climax and as a connective to the\nbeginning of the recapitulation.\n\nOp. 10/3-IV. The entire retransition detives from the principal theme, beginning\nwith a quotation of the opening (m. 46), which, were it not in \u2018the wrong key\u2019, could\nbe mistaken for the recapitulation. Jt leads to the dominant region, using harmony\nfrom the tonic minor, and is followed by a liquidating passage (m. 50), derived from\nm. 3 of the theme.\n\nOp. 22-IV. The C-section of this rondo ends in the tonic minor (m. 103). Further\nmodulation would not harmonically be necessary. But perhaps a contrast was neces-\nsary because much of the preceding section was in or around dp minor. This is pro-\nvided by a turn to a rather remote region (m. 105) and a subsequent remodulation.\nThe thematic material of these measures is practically a transposition of the main\nmotive, which is neutralized in the continuation.\n\naad rreervreverery\n\nTHE PARTS OF LARGER FORMS 183\n\nTHE GROUP OF SUBORDINATE THEMES\n\nSubordinate themes may have originated as condensations and stabilizations within\na contrasting modulatory movement. At first little more than episodes, they later\ndeveloped into definite subsidiary sections, establishing and ending in a related key,\ne.g. dominant or relative major.\n\nIdeally, subordinate themes are derivatives of the basic motive, even though the\nconnexion may not be readily visible. Contrast in mood, character, dynamics,\nthythm, harmony, motive-forms and construction should distinguish main themes\nfrom subordinate, and subordinate themes from each other.\n\nAesthetically, the most important type of contrast is that of construction, since it\nis evidence of subordination. Repetitions within the main theme enhance memorability\nand, through variation, PREPARE FOR development and elaboration. [n subordinate\nthemes mere repetition and juxtaposition often REPLACE development and elaboration.\n\nThus there are frequently a number of distinct formulations, each established and\nthen abandoned to make way for the next-\u2014-the Group of subordinate themes.\n\niilustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/1-I. In m. 21-25, a phrase appears three times. It is followed by a little seg-\nment juxtaposed in m. 26 and partially repeated in m. 31-32. In m. 33, a new con-\ncluding segment is again juxtaposed and, in turn, repeated. Codettas begin in m. 41.\n\nOp. 2/2-I. Here the group of subordinate themes is similarly organized. The little\nsegment in m. 59-62 is twice sequentially repeated. In m. 70 a two-measure segment\nderived from the end of the previous pattern is stated and also sequenced twice. In\nm. 76 derivatives of the principal theme are juxtaposed without any connective.\nA cadential segment (m. 84) and its repetition bring the subordinate section to a close\nin m. 92. Codettas follow.\n\nOp. 2/2-IV. A two-measure phrase (m. 27-28) is repeated and, after a partial\nsecond repetition, liquidated by means of sequential and other repetitions of a differ-\ning segment (m. 32-39).\n\nOp. 2/3-I. The first subordinate theme (m. 27) starts in the region of minor v, intro-\nduced by substitution for the preceding dominant of C. This relation to the transition\nis a peculiar case, paralleled by the first movement of the String Quartet, Op. 18/5\n(m, 25), but scarcely to be found in Beethoven\u2019s later works.\n\nA six-measure segment (m. 27-32) is repeated quasi-sequentially (m. 33-38).\nA different two-measure segment (m. 39-40) is juxtaposed, repeated and reduced to\ntwo one-measure variants (m. 43-44), A two-measure connective introduces another,\nmore lyrical theme (m. 47-61), which makes interesting use of imitations and exchange\nbetween voices in the manner of double counterpoint. Other distinct formulations\nappear in m. 61, 69, 73. Codettas follow.\n",
