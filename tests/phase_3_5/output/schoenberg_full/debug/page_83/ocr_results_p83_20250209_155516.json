It ts usually linked with the B-sectton by an upbeat chord.\nThis upbeat chord (dominant, artificial domimant, etc.) is frequently reinforced by\ndwelling upon it, often over a pedal point. Sometimes a small connective is added.\n\nHlustrations from the literature\n\nHaydn and Mozart built many themes of minuets of an uneven number of measures.\nIn Ex. 114 the A-section is a period of ten measures (5+ 5). In the recapitulation it is\nTepeated without change, and a ten-measure added section (codetta) is built from\na one-measure rest and nine measures of content.\n\nHaydn, String Quartet, Op. 76/2-III (Ex. 115). The a-section of the Minuet con-\nsists of 5+ 6 measures, but it might also be analysed as 4 { 4 | 3. This ambiguity is due\nto the canonic imitation, which shifts the ending of the first segment to the fifth\nmeasure.\n\nAlthough many movements in the classic literature combine the homophonic and\nthe contrapuntal technique, there is a fundamental difference between them. The\nhomophonic-melodic treatment depends basically on development of a motive by\nvariation. In contrast, the contrapuntal treatment does not vary the motive, but dis-\nplays the possibilities of combination inherent in the basic theme or themes.\n\nThe Minuet in Mozart's String Quartet in A, K.V. 464 (Ex. 116), is a rare example\nof the real fusion of the two techniques. The three motives, A, B and c, can all be con-\nsidered circumscriptions of a fourth (see Ex. 117). The two principal subjects, a and B,\nadmit canonic imitations and inversions; they even appear simultaneously with their\ninversions. Their combination appears in prime, octave and lower sixth. In measure\n59-60 the combination is inverted in the upper seventh, and B accompanies A in canonic\nimitation. In the contrasting middle section a sequence of B is accompanied by the\ninterval of a fourth, which (Ex. 117) can be derived from both a and B by reduction.\n\nBeside the display of contrapuntal values, one finds also the usual variation of basic\nmotives (m. 22-24); and there is even a codetta (m. 25-28).\n\nBeethoven, Op. 2/1-ILI. The rather distantly related motive form in m. 11-12, and\nits repetition (m. 13-14) may be considered the consequence of many repetitions within\nthe a-section. The sequential modulation in the contrasting middle section leads to\nthe subdominant with the previously mentioned motive-form (m. 20). In m. 23 and\n24 it is reduced (liquidated) to three notes, which are then reassembled in a chain of\neighth notes moving to the dominant. The a'-section is a reformulation, omitting\nentirely the content of m. 3-4.\n\nOp. 10/3-III. The contrasting middle section is built from a two-measure phrase\n(m. 17-18) which is a remote derivation from the A-section (see Ex. 118). It makes\nfour appearances, moving in a circle of fifths (iii-vi-1#-V). The structural reformula-\ntion of the a!-section does not involve the antecedent, which is merely a \u2018reinstru-\n\n\">: eg\n\nTHE MINUET 143\n\nmentation\u2019 (m, 25-32), The consequent is lengthened by the insertion of a climactic\nsequence introducing the cadential subdominant; its ending (m. 43) is approached\nthrough a number of passing harmonies. Several codettas conclude the Minuet.\n\nOp. 22-HII. The trill-like segment (m. 9. 13) of the contrasting middle section can\nbe derived from the first three eighth-notes in the left hand of m. 2, under the influence\nof the sixteenth-notes throughout the a-section, The phrase, m. 11-12. derives from the\nbeginning phrase, from which all of the a-section is derived (Ex. 119). The recapitula-\ntion, substantially unvaried. is concluded by several codcttas.\n\nThe contrasting middie sections of these three, and many other, minuets resemble\nthe elaboration (development, Durchfiiirung) to be discussed under the Scherzo. In\nthese, and in some movements not specifically called Minuets (Op. 7 II, Op. 27/2\nH), the chief characteristic is the sequential modulation. The end of the section is\noften marked by dwelling on the dominant over a pedal point. The pedal point is a\nretarding device. It should be employed where the harmony must be prevented from\ntoo rapid or too distant development. Usually the sustained note is in the bass, and\nthe upper voices carry out a progression from V to V.\n\nFor the recapitulation (a'-section), the same principles discussed in the chapter on\nthe Small Ternary Form apply. Since Mozart, it has become almost a point d*honneur\nnot to use an unvaried repetition, but to reformulate and reconstruct. Such a case\nis the Minuet from Mozart's String Quartet in 4, K.V. 464, quoted in Ex. 116,\n\nThe preservation of the rhythmic features is so strong a motive relation that it\nallows far-reaching variations of the intervals and the contour without producing\nincoherence. In Ex. 116 the recapitulation is quite obvious (m. 55) in spite of such\nmelodic reconstruction.\n\nTHE TRIO\n\nMost of the dance forms are followed by a trio, and it is usual after the trio to\nrepeat the original dance. As a matter of fact, the trio is nothing else than a second\nminuet (march, waltz, scherzo; or\u2014as in the suites of Bach\u2014-a second courante,\nbouree or gavotte).\n\nIt is evident that this trio has to constitute a contrast. One assumes that there should\nalso be some thematic connexion. In former times the trio was either in the same\ntonality, or in the relation maggiore-minore (tonic major\u2014tonic minor), or vice versa.\nLater the contrast between relative major and minor was also used, as well as between\nother pairs of related keys.\n\nThe contrast in character might be, e.g. lyrical\u2014 rhythmical; melodious\u2014contra-\npuntal; melodious\u2014\u00e9tude-like; grazioso\u2014energico; dolce\u2014vivace; melancholy\u2014\ngay; et cetera and vice versa.\n\nConcerning the form, there may appear as many deviations in the trio as in the\nminuet itself: reductions, extensions, additional ideas, codettas, etc.\n\n",
