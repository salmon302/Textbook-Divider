It should be as functional as\npossible, and at best should act as a complement to the essentials of its subject: the\ntonality, rhythm, phrasing, contour, character and mood. It should reveal the inherent\nharmony of the theme, and establishes a unifying motus. It should satisfy the necessi-\nties and exploits the resources of the instrument (or group of instruments).\nAccompaniment becomes imperative if the harmony or rhythm is complicated.\nIn descriptive music, the accompaniment contributes much to the expressive sonority.\n\nOMISSIBILITY OF THE ACCOMPANIMENT\n\nOf course, unaccompanied music exists, in folk music, ancient church music,\nsolo sonatas for various instruments, etc. Unaccompanied segments often appear in\notherwise accompanied music. But even in simple folk music, where the melody\nrequires no harmonic support, an accompaniment (not structurally required) is\noften added.\n\nAny harmonically self-sufficient melodic segment may remain unaccompanied,\nsupplying contrast and transparency which may contribute to the character of the\npiece. Transparency is a merit in itself. Moreover, pauses never sound bad!\n\nUpbeats often remain unaccompanied, if there is no question about the harmonic\nmeaning. See, for example, Beethoven, Op. 2/1-II and III; Op. 2/2-II1; Op. 7-1V, etc.\n\nFrequently, the beginning segment of a theme is unaccompanied (or in unison).\nOp. 2/1-I; Op. 10/1-II1; Op. 10/2-I1; Op. 10/3-1 (m. 1-4 and m. 17-22); Op. 26-IV;\nOp. 28-III;} Op. 57-1.\n\nAn unaccompanied beginning where the treatment is contrapuntal or semi-\ncontrapuntal is self-explanatory. Op. 2/3-III; Op. 10/2-IIJ.\n\nUnaccompanied figures within a theme also occur. Op. 2/1-I; Op. 10/2-I; Op.\n10/3-I, m. 56 ff. and m. 105 ff.\n\nThe end of an elaboration is often unaccompanied. Op. 2/2, Rondo, m. 95 ff.;\nOp. 2/3, Scherzo, m. 37 ff.; Op. 13-1, m. 187 ff. Op. 53, Rondo presents a special\ncase (m. 98 ff.), where the remodulation from the relative minor to tonic is carried out\nin simple unison.\n\nThough the omission of accompaniment may contribute to transparency, it should\n\n1 A piquant ambiguity. The f\u00a2 could suggest the keys of F% or 8 (major or minor). That it implies D is\nonly unmasked in m. 5-8.\n\nTHE ACCOMPANIMENT 83\n\nbe confined to self-explanatory segments. Accompaniment of harmonically ambiguous\npassages is mandatory.\n\nTHE MOTIVE OF THE ACCOMPANIMENT\n\nAsa unifying device the accompaniment must be organized ina manner similar to the\norganization of a theme: by utilization of a motive, the motive of the accompaniment,\n\nThe motive of the accompaniment can seldom be worked out with as much variety\nand development as that of a melody, or theme. Its treatment consists, rather, of\nsimple rhythmic repetition, and adaptation to the harmony. Its special form must be\nso constituted that it can be modified, liquidated or abandoned, as the nature of the\ntheme demands.\n\nTYPES OF ACCOMPANIMENT\n\nChorale-like. This kind of accompaniment is rather seldom used in instrumental\nmusic. One finds it more often in homophonic choral music, in which all the voices\nsing the same rhythm according to the text, as in the Pilgrim\u2019s Chorus from Wagner\u2019s\nTannhduser, Ex. 62a. Some examples from instrumental music are shown in Exs.\n62b, c and d. See also Beethoven, Op. 14/2-11; Op. 31/3-II, Trio; Op. 53-1, m. 35 ff. ;\nOp. 78-I]; Op. 27/2-I1; Ex. 478.\n\nFiguration. The requirements of piano style are better fulfilled through the use of\nbroken chords, although the voice leading remains essentially chorale-like. Compare\nEx. 63a with Ex. 636, from which it is an extract. As in this case, a broken-chord\naccompaniment will use one or more special figures systematically\u2014the motive of\nthe accompaniment.\n\nIn general the accompaniment makes use of shorter notes than the melody (Exs.\n46e, 48d, 49a, 50b, 51d, 606). However, the contrary also occurs (Ex. 47c). There are\nalso innumerable cases like Ex. 45f.\n\nThe manner in which a figure can be maintained and adapted to the harmony can\nbe seen in Op. 2/1-I, m. 20-21 and 26 ff.; Op. 2/1-H, m. 9 ff. and 37 ff.; Op. 2/2-1,\nm. 58 ff.; Op. 10/3-II, m. 65 ff.; Op. 10/3-1II, Trio, etc. This type of accompaniment\nis usually not much more than figurated chorale harmony, and may lie in lower,\nmiddle or upper voices.\n\nThe motive of the accompaniment often includes auxiliaries, appoggiaturas,\nchanging notes, etc. (Op. 2/3-II, m. 11 ff.; Op. 7-IV, m. 64 ff.; Op. 10/2-I, m. 19 ff.).\nSometimes it includes a semi-contrapuntal movement of one of the voices (Op.\n10/1-I, m. 56 ff.).\n\nThe broken chords may of course be distributed in open position (Exs. 49a,\n64a, b, c). The Romantic style of transcription for piano is illustrated in Ex. 64d. The\nfigure in the left hand does not appear in the orchestral score. This technique of\nmaking the piano \u2018roar\u2019 was much abused during the nineteenth century.\n\n",
