Observe, in the wonder-\nful melody of Ex. 78a, how often he uses the highest register in this explosive outburst\nof emotion; how suddenly he jumps to the lowest register; what difficult and dissonant\nintervals are included within short phrases; how many syllables have to be pronounced\nin this rapid tempo (x); and observe especially the ending of this section (xx) with\na leap of a ninth. Exs. 784, c and d are historically interesting, since Wagner's great\ncritical opponent, Eduard Hanslick, maliciously quoted them to ridicule Wagner's\n\u2018melodious\u2019 voice writing.\n\nNo wonder that Debussy (Ex. 79) and Richard Strauss (Ex. 80), as followers of most\nof Wagner\u2019s musico-dramatic principles, took advantage of this progress in writing\nfor the voice, progress in writing which did not turn out to enhance singability.\n\nThe Italian composers, renowned for their great understanding and respect for the\nvoice, could not escape Wagner's influence. The Italian singer's facility in rapid\nenunciation (even superior to that of the French and Spanish), and in pronouncing\nmany successive syllables, has always allowed Italian composers to write such rapid\nsmall notes as in Ex. 81, from Rossini\u2019s Barber of Seville. By comparison, the examples\nfrom German music, Mozart's Magic Flute (Ex. 82), Beethoven's Fidelio (Ex. 83)\nand Schubert's Ungeduld (Ex. 84), seem slow; and so does the French example from\nAuber\u2019s Fra Diavolo (Ex. 85). But Verdi, in Otello (Ex. 86), surpasses these latter in\nvelocity, and surpasses Rossini in difficulty, by using a chromatic scale (x), and by\nintroducing a surprising change of metre (xx).\n\nMelodic progressions, like those of Moussorgsky (Ex. 87), undoubtedly influenced\nby Oriental folk-music, in turn influenced Western melodic writing. The example from\nPuccini (Ex. 88) is also folkloristic (pseudo-Chinese). Though Puccini was always pro-\ngressive in his harmony, the extreme modernism of this example is exceptional.\n\nOn the other hand, in Ex. 89, the music of Tchaikovsky, a contemporary of\nMoussorgsky, shows no relation to folklore, but rather to the average harmonic\nfeeling of the epoch; it resembles music of the Norwegian, Grieg (Ex. 75), more than\nthat of his Russian compatriots.\n\nThe examples from Bizet\u2019s Carmen (Ex. 90) and from songs by Schoenberg (Ex. 91)\nare based on extended tonality. The ear of the modern musician has gradually ac-\nquired the capacity to comprehend the most remote harmonies as coherent elements\nof a tonality. To composers of the Wagnerian and post-Wagnerian epoch, the use of\nsuch intervals and progressions as in Ex. 91, even in melodies, was as natural as the\nuse of scalewise movement or broken chords to their predecessors.\n\nThe preceding discussion has perhaps only clarified the limits of the melodious,\nbut has not determined what is unmelodious.\n\nMELODY AND THEME 101\n\nImbalance, incoherence, inadequate integration with the harmony or accompani-\nment, incongruity of phrasing and rhythm, are criteria of the unmelodious. A musi-\ncian of the nineties might have objected to Ex. 805 from Strauss\u2019s Salome, on the\ngrounds that the multitude of incoherent rhythmic features produces imbalance, and\nmakes the phrasing\u2014-which should contribute to understanding\u2014incomprehensible.\nMoreover, it would be difficult to imagine with what harmony the melody of Ex. 80a\ncould be integrated.\n\nBut in works of the post-Wagnerian composers, the voice does not always have the\nmain melody (an excuse\u2014but only an excuse\u2014for imbalance). Where so many fea-\ntures contradict the melodious, the man of the nineties would not be entirely wrong\nto call these cases unmelodious. However, with the passage of time the concepts have\nchanged considerably.\n\nINSTRUMENTAL MELODY\n\nThe freedom of instrumental melodies is also restricted by the technical limitations\n\nof the various instruments. These limitations differ in nature and degree, particularly\nwith respect to the compass, from those of vocal music. Nevertheless, an instrumental\nmelody should still be such that, ideally, it could be sung, if only by a voice of in-\ncredible capacity.\nTo the contemporary car the difference between instrumental and vocal melodies\nin classical music does not seem very great. With slight changes the difference can be\neliminated. For instance, the leading subject of Beethoven's Rondo, Op. 2/2-1V, is\ndistinctly pianistic. In Ex. 92 the brilliant arpeggio of the first measure is simplified,\nwhich automatically eliminates the large leap of m. 2. The result is a perfectly singablc\nmelody. Such adaptation to the requirements of the voice was often used in classical\noperas. Sometimes, when the voice repeated an instrumental melody from the pre-\nlude, the melody was simplified, as in Ex. 93; or embellished as in Ex. 94,\n\nBut even in the Beethoven piano sonatas there are many melodies which could be\nsung by any singer. See, for example, the leading subjects of Op. 2/2-II; Op. 7-IV;\nOp. 10/1-I1; Op. 10/3-IN; Op. 13-1], etc.\n\nMany sections, in instrumental music, cannot be called melodies, though they may\ncontain nothing unmelodious. Some are \u00e9tude-like, c.g. Op. 7-1V, m. 64; Op. 10/2-1,\nm. 95 ff.; Op. 22-IV, the semi-contrapuntal section, m. 72-79. But others must be\nclassified as themes,\u2019 which, precisely defined, differ markedly from melodies in struc-\nture and tendency.\n\nMELODY VERSUS THEME\n\nThe term theme is here used to characterize specific types of structures, of which\nmany examples can be found in sonatas, symphonies, etc. Perhaps the most clearcut\n\n1 This term is one of the most misused terms in the musical vocabulary. It is applied without discrimination\nto many different structures.\n\n",
