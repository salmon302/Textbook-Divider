Technical advice can be formulated more easily in the negative than in the\npositive. The sense of melody enables one who has it to do the right thing at once\nwithout the intervention of self-criticism, but even a master may stray on to the wrong\ntrack, When such a deviation occurs, one has to discover where and why one erred,\nand which is the right track. And therefore, self-criticism is necessary to a composer\ngifted or not.\nThe best tool of a musician is his ear. Therefore:\n\nI. LISTEN!\n\nPlay or read harmony and melody separately several times. This sometimes pre-\nvents self-deception. Perhaps only one of these factors is poor, its shortcomings hidden\nbehind the virtues of the other. If the harmonic progression is satisfactory the\nbeginner may easily overlook shortcomings in his melody. A good melody should be\nsmooth, fluent and balanced when it is played without accompaniment.\n\n2. ANALYSE\n\nBe conscious of the significant features of the basic motive, and determine whether\nthey, or the less characteristic, are developed. There may be empty segments with no\nreal content, without significant melodic or rhythmic movement, even without har-\nmonic change.\n\n3. ELIMINATE NON-ESSENTIALS\n\nToo much variation, too much embellishment and figuration, excessively remote\nmotive-variations, too abrupt a change of register, may contribute to imbalance.\n4. AVOID MONOTONY\n\nToo many repetitions of tones or melodic figures are annoying, if they do not\nexploit the advantage of a repetition \u2014emphasis. Watch especially the highest tone\nof the melody. The climax normally appears toward the end, and can be repeated or\n\n1 a . . .\nimaginat good musician must possess the \u2018inner ear\u2019, auditory imagery, the capacity of hearing music in\nination.\n\n\u2014\u2014 le ee ee ee ee\n\n\u201c27 reewrwwwrewere ere ev eee eee ee ee ee\n\nADVICE FOR SELF-CRITICISM 117\n\nexceeded only with caution. Beware of too restricted a compass, and avoid moving\ntoo long in one direction. Evaluate sensitively the endings of the phrases.\n\n5. WATCH THE BASS LINE\n\nThe bass was previously described as a \u2018second melody\u2019. This means that it is sub-\nject to somewhat the same requirements as the principal melody. It should be rhyth-\nmically balanced, should avoid the monotony of unnecessary repetitions, should have\nsome variety of contour, and should make full use of inversions (especially of seventh\nchords). Chromatic progression can be as melodically advantageous in the bass as in\nthe principal melody. Semi- and quasi-counterpoint, such as can be seen in Exs. 44g,\ni,j, 48a and 58g, help to make the bass interesting.\n\nILLUSTRATIONS OF SELF-CRITICISM\n\nEx. 105,! a small ternary form with a number of alternative contrasting middle\nsections, can be used to show the application of some of these precepts.\n\nIn Ex. 105a@ the break in continuity at the end of the second phrase (m. 4) seems too\npronounced. The discontinuity is intensified by the stepwise progression across the\nbar line. The addition of a connective chord (small notes) maintains the melodic and\nrhythmic flow and enhances the harmonic logic. Similarly, the half-note in the first\nhalf of m. 8 is somewhat weak and empty. The small notes keep the melody alive to\nthe end of the phrase.\n\nMore generally, one might point out that the repeated notes in the first eight mea-\nsures are somewhat overdone, as are the parallel thirds in the last half. Of course,\nthese features are intended to demonstrate in easily recognizable form the use of\nmotival characteristics.\n\nIn Ex. 105c the chromatic return to V at the last moment is too crowded with rapid\nharmonic change to balance the preceding sparse harmonization. Moreover, it would\nnot connect well with m. 13 of Ex. 105a.\n\nThe active movement in Ex. 105f is hardly adequate to disguise the rather static\nharmony.\n\nEx, 105g, on the other hand, is so filled with remote and rapidly changing har-\nmonies that it fails to balance the preceding and following sections of Ex. 105a.\n\n6. MAKE MANY SKETCHES\nChange the method of variation frequently. Try each method several times. Join\nthe best sketches to produce others and improve them until the result is satisfactory.\nTo make sketches is a humble and unpretentious approach toward perfection.\nA beginner who is not too self-assured, who does not believe too firmly in his\n\n2 Exs, 101-7 after Chapter XIII, p. 126.\n\n",
