Its greatest merit, which enabled it to hold a commanding position\nover a period of 150 years, is its extraordinary flexibility in accommodating the widest\nvariety of musical ideas, long or short, many or few, active or passive, in almost any\ncombination. The internal details may be subjected to almost any mutation without\ndisturbing the aesthetic validity of the structure as a whole.\n\n+ The customary term, \u2018development\u2019, for this section, is a misnomer. It suggests germination and growth\nwhich rarely occur. The thematic elaboration and modulatary \u2018working out\u2019 (Durchfihrung) produce some\nvariation, and place the musical elements in different contexts, but seldom lead to the \u2018development\u2019 of\nanything new.\n\n7\u2018 + fv \u00a9 eer rF ree\n\nTHE SONATA-ALLEGRO 201\n\nThe diagram below indicates the basic relationships of the form and some of its\npossible ramifications.\n\nIt is assumed that the sonata-\u2014allegro is a very extended and complex form. This is\nnot necessarily true. The so-called SONATINA does not differ essentially from those\nsonata\u2014allegros in which the minimum number of parts is used, and each is very small;\ne.g. Op. 14/1, Op. 49/1, Op. 78, Op. 79. The length may vary between 100 measures\n\nStructural Relations\u2014Sonata-Allegro\nA B Al\n\n> eames Pantin A AT\nA B Elab. A!

There may be the most complete diversity in the relative lengths\nof the elements of the form.\n\nWhile the Durchfiihrung is usually considered the most characteristic feature, in\nmany important works it is short and sketchlike. While one expects this section to be\ndevoted to development only of the most important themes from the first division,\nsometimes the elaboration deals with themes which were unimportant or subordinate\nat their first appearance; and occasionally an idea appears which, though deriving\nfrom the basic material, never appeared before as formulated. Varied as the specific\ncases may be, the formal purpose of this section is, as with other contrasting middle\nsections, to provide a RELATED CONTRAST.\n\nThe elaboration is ESSENTIALLY MODULATORY, and for very good reasons. As the\nform developed the first division became longer, composed of a greater number of\nparts; more means of contrasting and joining them were used; more ways of building\nand limiting themes became necessary; a unifying restriction of the harmony became\nadvisable to preserve the stability of the themes in spite of the internal harmonic\nvariety. Thus in the exposition, though some parts modulate and others express a\n(related) contrasting tonality, apart from transitions, everything stands solidly within\nthe region of a definite tonality. In other words, the harmony is essentially stable.\n\nThis requires a different kind of contrast in the elaboration.\n\nEconomy dictates the use of previously \u2018exposed\u2019 thematic material (a wealth of\ndiffering ideas is presented in the first division). Variety requires roving, modulating\nharmony as a contrast to the generally stable nature of the exposition.\n\nTHE EXPOSITION\n\nThe exposition resembles the first division of the larger rondos in several respects.\nThe statements of the principal and subordinate themes are in contrasting but related\n",
