However, the mechanics of combination can be described\nand demonstrated, while temporarily disregarding the stiffness of some of the\nresulting phrases.\n\nCommon content, rhythmic similarities and coherent harmony contribute to logic.\nCommon content is provided by using motive-forms derived from the same basic\nmotive. Rhythmic similarities act as unifying elements. Coherent harmony\u2019 reinforces\nrelationship.\n\nIn a general way every piece of music resembles a cadence, of which each phrase will\nbe a more or less elaborate part. In simple cases a mere interchange of I-V-I, if not\ncontradicted by controversial harmonies, can express a tonality. As used in traditional\nmusic, such an interchange is generally concluded with a more elaborate cadence.*\n\nOrdinarily the harmony moves more slowly than the melody; in other words, a\nnumber of melodic notes usually refers to a single harmony (Exs. 43, 44, 45, 58, etc.).?\nThe contrary occasionally occurs when the harmony moves quasi-contrapuntally\nagainst a melody in long notes (Exs. 5lc, m. 17, 58g). Naturally, the accompanying\nharmony should reveal a certain regularity. As motive of the harmony and motive of\nthe accompaniment, through motive-like repetitions, this regularity contributes to\nunity and comprehensibility (Chapter IX).\n\nA well-balanced melody progresses in waves, i.e. each elevation is countered by\na depression. It approaches a high point or climax through a series of intermediate\nlesser high points, interrupted by recessions. Upward movements are balanced by\ndownward movements; large intervals are compensated for by conjunct movement in\nthe opposite direction. A good melody generally remains within a reasonable com-\npass, not straying too far from a central range.\n\nBUILDING PHRASES\n\nExs. 30-34 show various methods of producing a large number of different phrases\nout of one basic motive. Some of them might be used to begin a theme, others tc\n\n1 The concept of coherent harmony used here is deduced from the practice of the period from Bach to\nWagner.\n\n\u00ae For evaluation and explanation of the \u2018root progressions\u2019, see Arnold Schoenberg, Theory of Harmony,\npp. 70 ff., and Structural Functions of Harmony, Chapter Il.\n\n3 Exs. 42-51 at end of Chapter VII; Exs. 52-61 at end of Chapter VIII.\n\nCONNECTING MOTIVE-FORMS 17\n\ncontinue it; and some, especially those which do not begin with I, as material to\nmeet other structural requirements, e.g. contrasts, subordinate ideas and the like.\nMotivic features are indicated by brackets and letters. A detailed analysis will reveal\nmany additional relationships to the basic motive.\n\nIn Ex. 31 the original form is varied by adding ancillary notes, though all notes of\nthe basic motive are retained. In Ex. 32 the rhythm is preserved, producing closcly\nrelated motive-forms in spite of changes in interval and direction. Combined with\ntranspositions to other degrees, this procedure is often used in traditional music to\nproduce entire themes (see, for example, Ex. 52). In such cases each note of the melody\nis either a harmony note or a non-chordal note that corresponds to onc of the estab-\nlished conventional formulas.\n\nin Ex. 33 more far-reaching variations are produced by combining rhythmic changes\nwith the addition of ancillary notes, as well as with changes of interval and direction.\nEven though some of the examples are rather stiff and overcrowded, the practice of\nmaking such sketches, which attempt various methods of variation, should never be\nabandoned. _\n\nOther far-reaching variations are shown in Ex. 34, Through such rhythmic shifting\nand rearrangement of features, material is produced for the continuation of extended\nthemes, and for contrasts. But the use of such remotely related motive-forms may\nendanger comprehensibility.\n\nIn working out derivatives of a motive, it is important that the results have the\ncharacter of true phrases\u2014of complete musical units.\n",
