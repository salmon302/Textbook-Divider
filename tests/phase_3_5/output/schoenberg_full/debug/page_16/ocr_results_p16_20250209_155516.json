By note repetitions (Exs. 17, i, &, /, 7).\n\n3. By repetition of certain rhythms (Exs. 17/, m, 18).\n\n4. By shifting rhythms to different beats (Ex. 23; in particular, compare 23d with\n23e, f, g).\n\n5. By addition of upbeats (Ex. 22).\n\n6. By changing the metre\u2014a device seldom usable within a piece (Ex. 24).\n\nThe intervals are changed:\n\n. By changing the original order or direction of the notes (Ex. 19).\n. By addition or omission of intervals (Ex. 21).\n\nBy filling up intervals with ancillary! notes (Exs. 18, 20 ff.).\n\nBy reduction through omission or condensation (Ex. 21).\n\n. By repetition of features (Exs. 20h, 22a, 5, d).\n\n. By shifting features to other beats (Ex. 23).\n\nEx.13\n\nAnPwn-\n\nThe ftarmony is changed:\n\n1. By the use of inversions (Exs. 25a, 5).\n\n2. By additions at the end (Exs. 25 c-i).\n\n3. By insertions in the middle (Ex. 26).\n\n4. By substituting a different chord (Exs. 27a, b, c) or succession (Exs. 27d-i).\n\nThe melody is adapted to these changes:\n\n1. By transposition (Ex. 28).\n\n2. By addition of passing harmonies (Ex. 29).\n\n3. By \u2018semi-contrapuntal\u2019 treatment of the accompaniment (Ex. 29).\n\nSuch exploration of the resources of variation can be of great assistance in the\n\nacquisition of technical skill and the development of a rich inventive faculty. Ex.15\n\n2 In order to avoid aesthetically misleading and corrupted terms, ancillary will be preferred in referring\nto the so-called \u2018embellishing\u2019 or \u2018ornamental\u2019 notes of conventional melodic formulas.\n\nevvrv\u2014v\u2014vvvVvVvTVvTrvvTrvrrTTt Sette TEE EET Se SFT FT SEE FT FCT FT EF FST SET STS STS SE SE ee a\n",
