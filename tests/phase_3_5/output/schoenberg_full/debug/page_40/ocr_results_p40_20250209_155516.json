COMPLETION OF THE SENTENCE\n\nA PIECE of music resembles in some respects a photograph album, displaying under\nchanging circumstances the life of its basic idea\u2014its basic motive.\n\nThe circumstances which produce these various aspects of the basic motive\u2014its\nvariations and devclopments-\u2014derive from considerations of variety, structure, ex-\npressiveness, etc.\n\nIn contrast to the chronological succession in a photograph album, the order of\nmotive-forms is conditioned by the requirements of comprehensibility and musical\nlogic. Thus, repetition, control of variation, delimitation and subdivision regulate\nthe organization of a piece in its entirety, as well as in its smaller units.\n\nThe sentence is a higher form of construction than the period. It not only makes\na statement of an idea, but at once starts a kind of development. Since development\nis the driving force of musical construction, to begin it at once indicates forethought.\nThe sentence form is much used in leading themes of sonatas, symphonies, etc; but\nit is applicable also to smaller forms.\n\nThe beginning of the sentence (Chapter V) already includes repetition; hence, the\ncontinuation demands more remotely varied motive-forms. In masterpieces this has\ngiven rise to a great variety of structures, some of which will be discussed later. But\nthere are also a great many examples similar to the scheme that will serve as a practice\nform.\n\nThe practice form will consist, in the simpler cases, of eight measures, of which the\nfirst four comprise a phrase and its repetition. The technique to be applied in the\ncontinuation is a kind of development, comparable in some respects to the con-\ndensing technique of \u2018liquidation\u2019. Development implies not only growth,\naugmentation, extension and expansion, but also reduction, condensation and\nintensification. The purpose of liquidation is to counteract the tendency toward\nunlimited extension.\n\nLiquidation consists in gradually eliminating characteristic features, until only un-\ncharacteristic ones remain, which no longer demand a continuation. Often only resi-\ndues remain, which have little in common with the basic motive. In conjunction with\na cadence or half cadence, this process can be used to provide adequate delimitation\nfor a sentence.\n\nThe liquidation is generally supported by a shortening of the phrase. Thus in\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE THEMES (4) 59\n\nExs. 52@ and 6, the two-measure phrases are reduced or condensed! (in m. 5-6) to\none measure; and in Ex. 52c, four measures are condensed to two measures (m. 9-10\nand 11-12). This procedure sometimes results in still smaller units: in Ex. 526 a\nhalf-measure; in Ex. 52\u00a2 one measure.\n\nThe end of a sentence calls for the same treatment as the consequent of a period.\nA sentence may close on I, V or III, with a suitable cadence: full, half, Phrygian,\nplagal; perfect or imperfect; according to its function.\n\nCOMMENT ON EXAMPLES\n\nExs. 54, 55and 56 are based on the broken-chord form, Ex. 76. By progressive varia-\ntion (Exs. 54a, 6, c) a motive-form is reached which can be used to build sentences of\nsharply contrasted character. The endings lead to V and II] in major; to v and V in\nminor. To indicate how easy it is to change the cadence region, even at the very end,\nalternatives are added for Exs. 56a and b, ending in the region of the relative major\n(study also the Trio of Beethoven\u2019s Op. 28-II]).\n\nSequence-like procedures? are very useful in the continuation of a sentence. The\npattern for such sequence treatment is usually a transformation or condensation of\npreceding motive-forms. Assuming a correct harmonic connexion, the pattern may\nbegin on any degrce.\n\nThe quasi-sequential repetitions in Exs. 54, 55 and 56 are more or less free trans-\npositions of the pattern a whole- or half-tone up or down, except in Ex. 56 where\nthe interval is a fourth down.\n\n1 Reduction may be accomplished by merely omitting a part of the model. Condensation implies com-\npressing the content of the model, whereby even the order of the features may be somewhat changed.\n\n* A sequence, in its strictest meaning, is @ repetition of a segment or unit in its entirety, including the\nharmony and the accompanying voices, transposed to another degree.\n\nA sequence can be executed without using other than diatonic tones; in such cases, the harmony remains\n\u2018centripetal\u2019, i.e. centred about the tonic region. Diatonic sequences express the tonality clearly and do not\nendanger balance in the continuation.\n\nWhen substitutes (\u2018altered\u2019 or \u2018chromatic\u2019 chords) are used, the tendency of the hamnmony may become\ncentrifugal'\u2014may produce modulations, to balance which becomes a problem. Substitutes should be used\nprimarily to reinforce the logic of the progression, carefully observing the quasi-melodic function of the\nsubstitute tones. For cxample, a substituted major third tends to lead upward, while a substituted minor\nthird leads down.\n\nThe pattern for a sequence must be so built, harmonically and melodically, that it introduces the degree on\nwhich the sequence is to begin, and provides a smooth melodic connexion.\n\nSequences in minor are even more apt to produce modulation than in major, because of the varying forms\nof the minor scale. In actual practice, sequences in minor are most often built around the natural or descend-\ning form: but the strategic reintroduction of the leading-tone is used to prevent premature modulation.\n\nSequential treatment is not always complete. [t may be applied to either melody or harmony alone, the\nremaining element being more or less freely varied. Such cases may be called miodified ot partial sequences.\nIn other cases the general character of a transposed repetition may be present, though without literal trans-\nposition of any clement. These instances, and others involving variation of some features, may be described\nus quasi-sequential,\n\n",
