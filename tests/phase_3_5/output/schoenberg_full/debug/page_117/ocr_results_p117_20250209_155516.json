The first nineteen measures are repeated without change (m. 225-43).\nThe continuation, m. 20-31, is omitted, and replaced by a seven-measure segment\n(m. 244-50) which uses motive-forms from the preceding cadence. The transition\nbegins to change in m. 255; from m. 258 on, it is repeated with minor changes, partly\na fifth lower and partly a fourth higher. The remainder of the recapitulation is a mere\ntransposition to the tonic key, with slight changes and adaptations of the register.\nThere is no coda.\n\nOp. 2/3-I. Certain odd features of the exposition contribute to the changes in the\nrecapitulation. The transition segment, m. 13-21, provides motive-forms used also in\nthe subordinate group, m. 61-69. The transition ends, curiously, on I of the dominant\nregion instead of the usual upbeat chord. The contrast factor is preserved because the\nfirst section of the subordinate group lies in g (minor v).\n\nIn the recapitulation the leading theme is repeated exactly (m. 139-46), but the\ncodettas of m. 9-12 are omitted. A new transitional segment, built from the motive-\nform of the preceding cadence, replaces the segment, m. 13-20, but arrives at exactly\nthe same point (m. 21 and m. 155). The remainder of the transition is repeated without\nchange and untransposed, arriving at V in m. 160. But the subordinate theme follows\nnow in c, instead of g.\n\nThe subordinate group is repeated without any significant change up to m. 218.\nHere a sudden shift, through a deceptive progression, to the region of Ab (flat sub-\nmediant) inaugurates the coda. The closing segment of the exposition (m. 85-90) is\npostponed to the very end of the coda.\n\nOp. 7-I. The leading theme (m. 189) is diverted in its fifteenth measure toward the\nsubdominant region, merging into a quite different transitional passage which is eight\nmeasures shorter than the equivalent passage in the exposition. The subordinate\ngroup recurs in the principal key (m. 221), with only superficial changes. The final\nclosing segment is interrupted (m. 313) to make way for the coda.\n\nOp. 10/2-I. Ambiguous relationships in the exposition may account for the curious\nstructure of the recapitulation. The principal theme ends in m. 18, on V of iit. The\nensuing section (which would ordinarily be a transition) begins stably in the key of\nC (V). Only its closing segment (m. 30-37) emphasizes the dominant of C. The\ncharacter of this passage is that of a subordinate theme.\n\nThe recapitulation (m. 118 ff.) begins, strangely, in D C(\u00a5\u00a5) with a quotation of the\nfirst twelve measures of the principal theme. The following six measures are modified\nto approach the dominant of F (1), like a transition built from the principal theme. But\nin m. 137 the second element of the principal theme (already presented in D, m. 122-9)\n\n\"\u201cvrrFeeevrvwyee -\n\nTHE SONATA-ALLEGRO 211\n\nrecurs in the principal key, F. The ambiguous segment referred to above (m. 19-37) now\nappears, transposed, like any subordinate theme, to F. But in lieu of m. 27-29, a quite\ndifferent modulatory segment of ten measures (m. 153-62) is inserted leading to C (V),\nwhich is now emphasized like the end of a transition, citing the remainder (m. 30-37)\nof the interrupted passage. The rest of the recapitulation is a repetition transposed\nto the tonic key without change except for two added measures (m. 187-8). There is\nno coda, but merely an additional repetition of the two-measure cadence at the end.\n\nOp. 10/3-I. A similar ambiguity in the exposition produces only minor changes in\nthis recapitulation, perhaps because of the length and large number of themes.\n\nThe beginning is repeated literally (m. 184) up to m. 197, where a new connective\nsegment built from the end of the theme (and one measure shorter) replaces the repeti-\ntion of the opening segment. The theme of m. 23, which originally appeared in & (vi),\nnow recurs in e (ii), intact except for the omission of two measures between m. 221\nand m. 225. The rest presents only minor changes up to m. 296, where an extension\nof the half-note theme and a reconstruction of the retransition introduce a coda con-\ntaining internal modulation.\n\nThe recapitulation in minor presents special problems, particularly when the\nsubordinate group is in major. The interchange of mode upon repetition in the prin-\ncipal key is not always practical; and remaining too long without relief in the minor\nbecomes tiresome. The adaptations made to solve these problems vary widely. A few\nrepresentative examples should be supplemented by further exploration.\n\nOp. 2/1-I. The transition (m. 109) is reconstructed, using the same motive-forms,\nabove a different harmonic skeleton. The entire subordinate group recurs in the\nprincipal key (f) without significant change. A short codetta is added.\n\nOp. 10/1-I. The leading theme is repeated (m. 168-90), omitting m. 23-31, which\nwere based on the opening motive-form. The transition (m. 191-214), substantially\nintact, now leads to V of f (iv), and the subordinate theme follows (m. 215) in F\n(IV)! Fourteen measures are repeated literally, providing contrast in major; then after\na short connective, the entire passage is repeated again in c, The remainder presents\nno significant change.\n\nOp. 13-I. The original transition is discarded in the recapitulation (m. 195 ff).\nIn m. 207 the end of the theme is diverted and extended leading to V of f (iv). The\nchief subordinate theme now recurs in f, but is soon (m. 231) diverted toward c. The\nremainder stays in the vicinity of the principal key, with, however, pervasive modi-\nfications of detail. A short coda is appended.\n\nString Quartet, Op. 18/4-1. A quite different solution appears here. The entire\nsubordinate group, originally in Ep (III), appears in the recapitulation in tonic major\n(C). The return to c occurs only at the second codetta (m. 199).\n\nMozart, String Quartet, d, K.V. 421-I. The entire subordinate group is recapitu-\nlated in tonic minor.
