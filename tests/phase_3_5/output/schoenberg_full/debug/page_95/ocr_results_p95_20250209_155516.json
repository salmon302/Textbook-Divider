This is due primarily to the origin of most\nof the terms: they are borrowed from other fields, such as poetry, architecture, paint-\ning and aesthetics. Terms like metre, symmetry, colour and balance are typical. But\neven worse is the use of single terms, like \u2018inversion\u2019, for several different things.\nOne speaks of the first or second \u2018inversion\u2019 of a triad; the \u2018inversion\u2019 of an interval;\nmirror-like \u2018inversion\u2019, vertical and horizontal; contrapuntal \u2018inversion\u2019, as in mul-\ntiple counterpoint.\n\nSimilarly, the term \u2018variation\u2019 has a number of meanings. Variation creates the\nmotive-forms for the construction of themes. It produces contrast in middle sections,\nand variety in repetitions. But in \u201cTheme and Variations\u2019 it is the structural principle\nfor a whole piece.\n\nProduction of an entire piece merely through the application of variation is an\napproach to the logic of larger compositions.\n\nAs the name indicates, the piece consists of a THEME and several VARIATIONS upon it.\nThe number of variations is determined by whether it is a movement in a cyclic work,\nlike Op. 26-1, Op. 14/2-I], Op. 111 I]; or an independent piece like the 32 Variations\ninc minor, ot the 33 Diabelli Variations, Op. 120. A middle movement in a cyclic work\nincludes a lesser number of variations. Often the piece is concluded by a coda, finale\nor fugue. In other cases the last variation is extended; and sometimes there is no\nspecial ending after the last variation.\n\nSTRUCTURAL CONSTITUTION OF THE THEME\n\nThere are themes which facilitate, and others which impede, the production of\nvariations. Variations are primarily repetitions, which would become intolerable\nwithout constant restimulation of the listener\u2019s interest. Hf the theme contains too\nmany and too interesting features, there remains little scope for the additions which\na simple theme readily permits.\n\nMany classical variations are based on popular or folk melodies of the time. But\nsuch variations as Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations; Beethoven's Op. 35, and the 32 Varia-\ntions; Brahms\u2019s String Quartet, Op. 67-1V and many others are based on the com-\nposer\u2019s own theme.\n\nA simple theme will consist of closely related motive-forms, in preference to distant\nones (Op. 14/2-TI). Structurally, the theme should show definite subdivision and clear\n",
