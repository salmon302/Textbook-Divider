It is significant that the melodic\napproach to a climax in m. 6 is supported by more frequent changes of the harmony\nand the increasing use of small notes. The downward movement after the climax is\nalso significant.\n\nOp. 2/2-1V. The caesura on V is reinforced by a half cadence in m. 4. Observe the\ncontrast between the first and second phrases. The consequent deviates harmonically\nin m. 6, ending with a full cadence on V (m, 8), as if in the key of the dominant. M. 7\nand 8, through remote variation and richer movement, produce the necessary intensi-\nfication of the cadence.\n\nOp. 10/3, Menuetto. The antecedent and consequent consist of eight measures\neach. In the first four measures of the consequent, the melody and harmony of the\nantecedent are transposed a note higher, without any other variation.\n\nOp. 10/3, Rondo. This period consists of nine measures, the irregularity resulting\nfrom the five measure consequent. The contrast in m. 3-4 makes use of a special\ndevice, a chain-like construction. Ex. 42a? shows that the end of each motive-form is\nthe beginning of the next; they overlap like the links of a chain. The consequent\nintroduces (m. 5-6) two sequences of the motive, in place of the single repetition in\nm. 1-2 (Ex. 426). A premature ending in the seventh measure is evaded through\na deceptive cadence, and completed with a varied repetition ending in m. 9.\n\nANALYSIS OF OTHER ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE LITERATURE\n\nIn Ex. 43 Bach\u2019s contrapuntal movement often conceals the caesura. But the period-\nlike repetition of motive-forms is evident. While one of the examples (Ex. 430) ends\non III (the relative major), three others are treated similarly to the Dorian mode;\ni.e. Exs. 43c and e reach the dominant through a quasi-Phrygian cadence, and Ex. 43d\nmust be classified as having a plagal cadence, though the upper voices, astonishingly,\nexpress the authentic cadence. Such a procedure is only justified by the motion of\nindependent parts.\n\nIn the Haydn examples, Ex. 44, the caesura (always on V) is sometimes approached\nthrough mere interchange, sometimes through half cadences, and occasionally through\nfull cadences. Exs. 44a, e and / are irregular, i.e. they consist of 10, 9 and 9 measures,\nrespectively. The structural meaning of the extensions is indicated. In all the examples\nm. 3-4 differ significantly from m. 1-2. Even in Ex. 44/, using continuous sixteenth-\nnotes, the figuration and the harmony of m. 3-4 are clearly differentiated. Observe\nespecially the relations and variations marked with brackets.\n\nIn some of the Mozart examples, Ex. 45, the repetition at the beginning of the\n\n1 An ending on a strong beat is called \u2018masculine\u2019, and on a weak beat, \u2018feminine\u2019. Too frequent use of\n\nthe same kind of ending is often monotonous.\n2 \u00a3xs, 42-51 appear at end of Chapter VI, pp. 32-57.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE THEMES (2) 27\n\nconsequent is slightly varied. In Exs. 45e and f, the inversion of I is used; in Ex. 45a\nthe whole consequent is shifted to the lower octave; in Ex. 45c\u00a2 the simple doubling\nof the bass produces an effective variation.\n\n\u2018The Beethoven examples, Ex. 46, are chosen principally from the viewpoint of\ncharacter. In Exs. 464, d and /, the consequent is built on the dominant. How many\nvariations a single rhythm can undergo is evident in Ex. 46d. Note that in both m. 6\nund m. 7, two harmonies are used (intensification of the cadence through concentra-\ntion). In Ex, 46e both the antecedent (five measures) and the consequent (seven mea-\nsures) show remarkable irregularities.\n\nAmong the Schubert examples, Ex. 47, two (Exs. 474, c) show how beautiful a\ninelody can be built from variations of a single rhythmic figure. Since rhythmic\nfeatures are more easily remembered than intervallic features, they contribute more\neffectively to comprehensibility. Constant repetition of a rhythmic figure, as in\npopular music, lends a popular touch to many Schubertian melodies. But their real\nnobility manifests itself in their rich melodic contour.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nIn the opening section of the sentence, m. 3-4 are constructed as a modified\nrepetition of the first phrase. The antecedent of the period introduces a new problem.\nSince the consequent is a kind of repetition, the antecedent should be completed with\nmore remote motive-forms in m. 3-4.\n\nAs a consequence of the \u2018tendency of the smallest notes\u2019,' one may expect an increase\n11 small notes in the continuation of the antecedent. This can be observed in the third\n(sometimes also in the fourth) measures of Exs. 44a, b, c, d, \u00a2, k, 45a, 6, c, d, jand 46\u00a2.\n\nBut the increase of small notes is only one way of constructing m. 3-4 as a contrast-\ning, yet coherent, continuation of m. 1-2. In Exs. 44f, A, i, j, 1, 45f, 46a, d, fand 478, c,\nde, the coherence is more evident than the contrast, which consists merely of a change\nof register, direction or contour.\n\nA coherent contrast can also be produced through a decrease of smaller notes, in\nwhich case the motive-form appears to be a reduction (Exs. 43a, 45/, 46g).\n\nSuch a decrease is often used to mark melodically the ending of the antecedent, the\ncaesura. Exs. 44a, d, g, h, i, 45b, 46e, f, g and 47a, d show this usage. Generally,\nthe caesura is supported by a contrast in the contour, which often descends below\nthe register of the beginning (Exs. 44c, d, f, k, 45g. /, 46e, 47a). Frequently the caesura\nis approached by receding from an earlier climactic point, as in Exs. 44a, \u00e9, j, k, 45a,\nb,c, fand 46a, b, e.\n\n' The smallest notes in any segment of a piece, even in a motive or motive-form, have an influence on\nthe continuation which can be compared to the momentum of acceleration in a falling body: thelonger the\nmovement lasts, the faster it becomes. Thus, if in the beginning only one sixteenth-note is used, very soon\nan increasing number will appear, growing often into whole passages of sixteenths. To restrict this tendency\nof the smallest notes requires special care.\n\n",
