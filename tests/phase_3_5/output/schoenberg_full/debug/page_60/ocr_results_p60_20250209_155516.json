Instinctively,\nevery music lover knows what a melody is. Instinctively, also, one who has talent may\nbe able to write a melody without technical advice. But such melodies seldom possess\nthe perfection of higher art. Therefore some guidance, based on musical literature, as\nwell as on historical, aesthetic and technical considerations, will be provided.\n\nInstrumental melodies admit much more freedom in every respect than vocal. But\nfreedom prospers best when under control. Accordingly, the restrictions of vocal\nmelody offer a sounder starting-point.\n\nVOCAL MELODY\n\nA melody could hardly include unmelodious elements; the concept of the melodious\nis intimately related to the concept of singableness. The nature and technique of the\nprimordial musical instrument, the voice, determines what is singable. The concept of\nthe melodious in instrumental melody has developed as a free adaptation from the\nvocal model.\n\nSingableness, in a more popular sense, implies relatively long notes; smooth linkage\nof the registers; movement in waves, more stepwise than by leaps; avoidance of aug-\nmented and diminished intervals; adherence to the tonality and its most closely\nrelated regions; employment of the natural intervals of a key; gradual modulation;\nand a cautious use of dissonance.\n\nAdditional restrictions derive from the registers of the voice, and from the diffi-\nculties of intonation (unless he possesses a memory for absolute pitch, the singer has\nno yardstick whatever for intonation).\n\nThe highest register of a voice is \u2018vulnerable\u2019; its use is always a strain on the singer.\nTo remain too long in it tires the voice. But used carefully, it really produces a climax,\nfor which it should be reserved (a structural consideration). The lowest register is\nstronger than the middle register, but should not be overburdened with too much\ndramatic expression. The middle register is not capable of extreme expression and\noffers no great dynamic compass, but within these limits it is the most convenient\nregister of every voice. And the registers differ not only in volume, but also in colour\n(timbre). Sudden changes of register endanger the unity of tone quality, a difficulty\nwhich, however, well-trained artists know how to overcome. The voice needs a certain\n\nMELODY AND THEME 99\n\nminimal time to develop a full sound. Accordingly, rapid notes, especially staccatos,\nand such notes as ask for a strong accentuation (sforzati, etc.), are difficult, though\nthey are not beyond the ability of a virtuoso.\n\nSupport of intonation, through harmony, is almost indispensable, especially at the\nbeginning. Chromaticism, augmented intervals (or successions of them), and tones (or\ntone successions) which cannot be related to the harmony, especially if outside the\ntonality, offer difficulties,\n\nOf course, not all the augmented or diminished intervals in Ex. 69, when accom-\npanied by comprehensible harmony, are excessively difficult. But some, like e, f, m,\n4, 0, p,q, rand \u00a2 are not easy. Successive leaps like those in Ex. 70, having a compass\nof a seventh or ninth, should be avoided.\n\nChromaticism is difficult partly because the natural semi-tones differ in size from\nthe tempered (a fact which causes choirs to get off pitch\u2019); but sparingly used it need\nnot be avoided. The dissonances in Exs. 7la\u2014d, as circumscribing or embellishing\nnotes, can easily be understood. Such cases as those in Exs. 71e-g require highly de-\nveloped technical skill, while those of Ex. 72 are difficult to justify.\n\nPrior to the great changes which began in the first quarter of the nineteenth century,\naestheticians could define melody in terms of beauty, expressiveness, simplicity,\nnaturalness, tunefulness, singableness, unity, proportion and balance. But taking into\naccount the development of harmony and its influence on every concept of musical\naesthetics, it is obvious that earlier definitions of \u2018theme\u2019 and \u2018melody\u2019, \u2018melodious\u2019\nand \u2018unmelodious\u2019, are no longer adequate.\n\nItustrations from the literature\n\nEach of the quotations from the vocal literature (Exs. 73-91) contradicts in some\nrespect the older limitations imposed on melody.\n\nAmong the examples from Schubert\u2019s Winterreise, Op. 89, the modulation in the\nfifth measure of Ex. 73a is unusually sudden and remote. In Ex. 735 a leap of a tenth\nappears, and in Ex. 73\u00a2 the \u2018Stormy Morning\u2019 is pictured so realistically and in such\ntapid tempo that it becomes difficult to sing.\n\nIn Ex. 74a (Brahms) the range spans an eleventh within two measures; in Ex. 746\na syncopated rhythm almost obscures the phrasing ; in Ex. 74c, \u2018The Forge\u2019, the illu-\nstration of the upswinging hammer precludes a natural legato and forces upon the\nvoice a staccato accentuation. But in Ex. 74d Brahms contradicts his own rule: \u2018The\nmelody of a song should be such that one could whistle it\u2019 (ic. without accompani-\nment, without the support of an explanatory harmony). Try to whistle this melody!\n\nDifficulties of intonation are also involved in Ex. 75 (Grieg), Ex. 76 (Wolf) and\nEx. 77 (Mahler). In the latter example not only the intervals and the rapid tempo,\n\n* A singer should be trained to the intervals of the tempered scale, which is a convention deviating from\nthe natural acoustical intervals, to assure correct musical intonation.\n",
