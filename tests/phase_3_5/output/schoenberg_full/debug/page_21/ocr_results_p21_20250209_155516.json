BEGINNING THE SENTENCE\n\nIN the first chapter, \u2018The Concept of Form\u2019, it was stated that a piece of music con-\nsists of a number of parts. They differ more or less in content, character and mood;\nin tonality, size and structure. These differences permit presentation of an idea from\nvarious viewpoints, producing those contrasts on which variety is based.\n\nVariety must never endanger comprehensibility or logic. Comprehensibility requires\nlimitation of variety, especially if notes, harmonies, motive-forms or contrasts follow\neach other in rapid succession. Rapidity obstructs one\u2019s grasp of an idea. Thus pieces\nin rapid tempo exhibit a lesser degree of variety.\n\nThere are means by which the tendency toward too rapid development, which is\noften the consequence of disproportionate variety, can be controlled. Delimitation,\nsubdivision and simple repetition are the most useful.\n\nIntelligibility in music seems to be impossible without repetition. While repetition\nwithout variation can easily produce monotony, juxtaposition of distantly related\nelements can easily degenerate into nonsense, especially if unifying elements are\nomitted. Only so much variation as character, length and tempo required should be\nadmitted: the coherence of motive-forms should be emphasized.\n\nDiscretion is especially necessary when the goal is an immediate intelligibility, as in\npopular music. However, such discretion is not restricted to popular music alone. On\nthe contrary, it is most characteristic of the manner in which the classical masters\nconstructed their forms. They sought a \u2018popular touch\u2019 in their themes, this being the\nslogan under which the \u2018ars nova\u2019 of the eighteenth century detached itself from the\nshackles of the contrapuntal style. (Thus, Romain Rolland, in his Musical Journey,\nquotes the German theorist, Mattheson, in his Vollkommener Kappelmeister (1739)\nas saying that in the \u2018new style\u2019 composers /ide the fact that they write great music.\n\u2018A theme should have a certain something which the whole world already knows.\u2019)\n\nTHE PERIOD AND THE SENTENCE\n\nA complete musical idea or theme is customarily articulated as a period or a sen-\ntence. These structures usually appear in classical music as parts of larger forms (e.g.\nas A in the ABA! form), but occasionally are independent (e.g. in strophic songs).\nThere are many different types which are similar in two respects: they centre around\na tonic, and they have a definite ending.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE THEMES (1) 2)\n\nIn the simplest cases these structures consist of an even number of measures, usually\ncight or a multiple of eight (i.e. 16 or, in very rapid tempos, even 32, where two or\nfour measures are, in effect, equal to the content of one).\n\nThe distinction between the sentence and the period lies in the treatment of the\nsecond phrase, and in the continuation after it.\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE SENTENCE\n\nThe construction of the beginning determines the construction of the continuation.\nIn its opening segment a theme must clearly present (in addition to tonality, tempo\nand metre) its basic motive. The continuation must mect the requirements of com-\nprehensibility. An immediate repetition is the simplest solution, and is characteristic\nof the sentence structure.\n\nIf the beginning is a two-measure phrase, the continuation (m. 3 and 4) may be\ncither an unvaried or a transposed repetition. Slight changes in the melody or harmony\nmay be made without obscuring the repetition.\n\nHlustrations from the literature}\n\nIn Exs. 58d, 59f and 60c, simple repetition appears with little or no change what-\nsoever, In Exs. 58e and g, although the harmony remains the same, the accompani-\nment is slightly varied and the melody transposed. In Ex. 58/ the lower octave is used.\nIn Exs. 59d and g the melody only is slightly varied. In Ex. 61c the second measure\nof the second phrase ascends in conformity with the progress of the harmony towards\nIII. Ex, 53@ presents an otherwise unvaried transposition to III (the relative major),\ni.c. a sequence. Ex. 57a is sequential in the melody and partially sequential in the\naccompaniment.\n\nTHE DOMINANT FORM: THE COMPLEMENTARY REPETITION?\n\nIn many classical examples one finds a relationship between first and second phrase\nsimilar to that of dx (tonic form) and comes (dominant form) in the fugue. This kind\nof repetition, through its slightly contrasting formulation, provides variety in unity.\n\nIn the repetition, the rhythm and contour of the melody are preserved. An element\nof contrast enters through the changed harmony and the necessary adaptation of the\nmelody.\n\nIn practising this type of continuation the tonic form may be based on: I, I-V,\n1 -V-1, L-IV or possibly I-II. In these simple cases the dominant form will contrast\nwith the tonic form in the following manner:\n\n\u201d Exs. 52-61 at end of Chapter VIII, pp. 63-81.\n* This is one of many examples of the difficulties associated with loose terminology, Tunic version and\n\ndominant version would be clearer and more precise, but Schoenberg preferred to use the more familiar\nterms (Ed.).\n\n",
