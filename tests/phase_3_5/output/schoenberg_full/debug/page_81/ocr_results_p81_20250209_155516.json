The\nritmo di tre battute, instead of connecting two units (2-4-1 or 1+2), reduces the four\nmeasures of the ritmo di quatro baitute to three (Ex. 110).\n\nIrregular construction becomes more frequent in the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury, Brahms and Mahler, under the influence of folk music, developed a feeling\nthat often led to free rhythmic organization which does not correspond to the bar\nlines (Ex. 11 1a, 6). In extreme cases frequent changes of metre have been used to bring\nabout a degree of correspondence between phrase structure and bar lines (Ex. 112).\n\nThus it becomes evident that master composers freely introduce irregular or non-\nsymmetrical procedures as demanded by the musical idea or the structure. Often such\nprocedures contribute fluency and spontaneity. But they are neither arbitrary nor\ncasual. On the contrary, a high degree of skill and sensitivity are necessary to achieve\nthe necessary balance and proportion.\n\neevrewr reer ere ee er er er eer ee eet ee\n\nUNEVEN, IRREGULAR AND ASYMMETRICAL CONSTRUCTION 139\n\nEx. 108\na) Hecthoven, String Quartet, Op.74-TIl\n\nea .
