Mathematics does not evoke emotions.\nSimilarly, from the viewpoint of pure aesthetics, music does not express the extra-\nmusical.\n\nBut from the viewpoint of psychology, our capacity for mental and emotional\nassociations is as unlimited as our capacity for repudiating them is limited. Thus\nevery ordinary object can provoke musical associations, and, conversely, music can\nevoke associations with extramusical objects.\n\nMany composers have composed under the urge to express emotional associations.\nMoreover, programme music goes so far as to narrate entire stories with musical\nsymbols. There also exist a great variety of \u2018characteristic pieces\u2019 expressing every\nconceivable mood.\n\nThere are Nocturnes, Ballades, Funeral Marches, Romances, Scenes from Child-\nhood, Flower Pieces, Novelettes, etc., by Chopin and Schumann.

Finally, there are songs, choir music, oratorios,\noperas, melodramas, ballets and motion-picture music.\n\nAll these categories are intended to produce not only musical impressions, but also\nto provoke secondary effects: associations of a definite character.\n\nThe term character, applied to music, refers not only to the emotion which the\npiece should produce and the mood in which it was composed, but also the manner in\nwhich it must be played. It is fallacious to think that the tempo indications determine\ncharacter. In classical music, at least, this is not true. There is not one adagio charac-\nter, but hundreds; not one scherzo character, but thousands. An adagio is slow; an\nallegro ts fast. This contributes something, but not everything, to the expression of a\ncharacter.\n\nThe type of accompaniment plays an important role in the establishment of charac-\nter. No player could express the character of a march if the accompaniment were that\nof a chorale; no one could play a restful adagio melody if the accompaniment were\nlike a torrent.\n\nOld dance forms were characterized by certain rhythms in the accompaniment,\nwhich were also reflected in the melody. These rhythmic characteristics are the\n\n",
