The figure in sixteenth-notes of the first three\nvariations is a combination of a broken chord with tone repetitions, the latter derived\nfrom the repeated G of the first three measures of the theme. The chythmicization of\nthe harmony in the first two variations also contributes to the motive of variation.\nExs. 125a and 6 show the derivation of the motives of variation for Variations 4 and\n5. In Variation 5, note the exchanged positions of C and \u00a35, an exchange which occurs\nelsewhere as well (see Variations 7 and 9).\n\nBrahms, Handel Variations. Brahms derives substantially all the motives for his\ntwenty-five variations from the features of the theme. For instance, the motive of the\nfirst variation derives from the bass of the first measure, doubly diminished rhyth-\nmically. Its rhythmical complement furnishes the accompaniment figure. The same\nthree notes in triplets form the motive for the second variation. The curious derivation\nof the motive in Variation 16 is shown in Exs. 127a and b.\n\nAPPLICATION AND ELABORATION OF THE MOTIVE OF VARIATION\n\nThe motive of variation must accommodate itself to every movement of the har-\nmony (which itself is subject to variation), and must contain all the principal tones of\nthe theme. Variety within the variation requires appropriate elaboration of the\nmotive. Additional elaborations are the consequences of such structural features as\ncadences, contrasts and subdivisions. This will result in variation within the variation.\n\nUlustrations from the literature\n\nBeethoven, Diabelli Variations. The contrast between the static harmony of m. 1-8\nand 17-24 and the sequences of m. 9-12 and 25-28 requires great flexibility in the\nmotives of variation. As a consequence, many are very short. Elsewhere the motive is\nadapted, or further varied, where the more rapid harmonic change occurs (e.g.\nVariations 3, 7, 8, 12, 18, 19 and 23). The sequences are varied in almost all the varia-\ntions by substituting different progressions, often very far-reaching, as for instance in\nVariation 5. Variation 20 is harmonically fantastic; even in the post-Wagnerian epoch\nit would have been called \u2018modernistic\u2019.\n\nBeethoven, /5 Variations in Ep, Op. 35. The three variations preceding the entrance\nof the theme are built merely as contrapuntal additions to the bass. In Variation |\n(following the theme) the motive is modified greatly (m. 5) in adaptation to the richer\nmovement of the harmony. The motive of Variation 3 is compounded of two elements,\nthe shifting of which deranges the phrasing. In m. 13 even the change of harmony\noccurs as an anticipation, on the weak beat. In many of these variations, which are\nwritten in a brilliant piano style, the specific formulation of the motive is less obli-\ngatory. The preservation of the motus admits rather remote changes. In Variation 4\n\n~~ - +, TrTrFrTrFYFY\u00a5TwyFevevVYTwwTvweyrewyvwyve\u00a2e?\n\nTHEME AND VARIATIONS 171\n\nthe sixteenth notes begin as scale lines; but in m. 9 they are changed to broken chords,\nand in m. 13 the system of arpeggiation is again changed. Variation 7, a canon in the\noctave, is an illustration of Beethoven's Olympic wit.\n\nThere are two variations in minor. Variation 14 in e>, deviates from the original\nharmony only in the use of some transformations (especially the Neapolitan sixth),\nBut the other, Variation 6, is extremely interesting. The theme, with insignificant\nadaptations, is harmonized almost entirely in c. Only the last two measures re-\nestablish Eb.\n\nBeethoven, 32 Variations in c miner, Variation 5 of the 32 Variations is an example\nof development within a variation. The sixteenth-notes of the motive of variation are\nan \u2018echo\u2019 of the sixteenth-notes of Variations 1-3. This rhythmic figure determines the\ncharacter of the variation. But the main feature, ,a, in Ex. 1256, derives from the\ntheme's m. 7-8, as demonstrated in Ex. 125c. The climactic development of m. 5-6 in\nthe theme is carried out here by a concentration, three forms of the motive squeezed\ntogether. Even more compressed are the imitative repetitions in m. 7-8.\n\nThe elaboration of some motives admits various treatments. The method of using\none idea in several variations, in quasi-contrapuntal inversion, occurs in Variations 1,\n2 and 3. The relation is similar between Variations 10 and 11; 20 and 21. This latter\npair is extended to a group of three by Variation 22, in which a\u2019simplification of the\ntriplet figure is treated in canonic imitation. Variations 15 and 16 are practically\nidentical, except for a slight rhythmic change.\n\nThe interchange of major and minor is a striking source of harmonic variety. But it\nis never carried out mechanically, by merely changing the kcy signature. For instance,\nin Variations 12, 13, 15 and 16, the +-F\u00a5 of m. 3-4 is replaced by \u00a54-II, and the\napproach to the cadence is also modified.\n\n{n the third measure of Variations 3 and 29 the } is replaced by a harmony whose\nappearance in c is difficult to understand; it is best interpreted as a passing harmony\nproduced by the parallel movement of bass and soprano.\n\nBrahms, Handel Variations, Op. 24. Brahms frequently produces new skeletons by\nchanging the viewpoint as to which are the main features and which are subordinate.\nThis enables him, for instance, to consider m. 7 of Variation 3 as an upbeat to the\ncadential subdominant of m. 8, converting the | chord into the dominant of the sub-\ndominant. He similarly simplifies m. 5 and 6 by omission of passing harmonies. This\nreduction to principal content, however, admits the contrary treatment in Variation 1\u2014-\nthe addition of passing harmonies (m. 6) required by the imitations in the main voice.\n\nIn Variation 2 Brahms ventures a far-reaching structural change, which is then\napplied in Variations 5, 11 and 20, as well. Half of m. | is repeated in m. 2 (Ex. 127c),\nwhich reduces the significance of m. 2 to that of a mere interpolation between m. |\nand 3. Thus the second measure has been subordinated to the first to produce a two-\nmeasure phrase.\n",
