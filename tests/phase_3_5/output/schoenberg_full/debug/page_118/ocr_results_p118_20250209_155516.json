Particularly striking is the\nshift of phrase after phrase by a half-measure, interchanging primary and secondary\naccents. Yet far-reaching as the changes are, the psychological effect is only that of\na variant; the recognizability of the repetition is not in the least endangered. Mozart\nexcelled in such subtle reconstruction.\n\nTHE CODA\n\nThe function of the coda, and techniques employed in it, were discussed in Chapter\nXVIIL. Its application to the sonata-allegro form does not differ from its use in the\ncases described there.\n\nThe presence or absence of a coda, its length and complexity, its character and\nthematic material, are subject to endless variety. Common features are: repeated\ncadences to the tonic; citation of previous themes; reduction in length and content\nof segments in approaching the end. In the more elaborate codas modulatory seg-\nments often appear as transient contrasts, returning to the tonic.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/1-I. A short codetta is added (m. 148-52).\n\nOp. 2/2-I. No additions.\n\nOp. 2/3-I. The closing theme ts interrupted (m. 218) by a deceptive progression to\nflat VI. Through modulatory broken chords and a cadenza, the tonic is reintroduced\nin m. 233, with a quotation of the leading motive. A passage reminiscent of the\nimitative syncopations in m. 123 ff. leads again through a rather extended cadence to\nthe tonic in m. 252, where the broken octaves that closed the exposition recur to close\nthe movement.\n\nOp. 7-I. The closing codettas of the recapitulation are enriched and extended (m.\n313 ff.), with a reference to the leading motive. Another segment, stressing movement\nfrom I to V, is built from the second subordinate theme (m. 324-39). A pedal point on\nV is reached in m. 339, over which the codetta figure recurs, treated like the end of\na retransition. The tonic is reached in m. 351 and prevails to the end.\n\nOp. 10/3-I. The exposition closes with a retransition (m. 114 ff.) which, in the\nrecapitulation, introduces the coda (m. 299). After emphasis of the subdominant\nregion, the dominant of flat II appears in m. 317, using the theme of m. 75. Through\nambiguous and modulatory harmony, the tonic is reapproached in m. 327. References\nto the beginning of the leading theme and neutral passage work, associated with an\nostinato repetition of the tonic, bring the movement to a close.\n\nMozart, Symphony, g, K.V 550-I. The coda includes a modulatory passage (m.\n280-4) and imitative, liquidated quotations of the leading motive (m. 286-92) between\nthe two codetta figures.\n\n- sew eeervrrFe\u2019\n\nTHE SONATA-ALLEGRO 213\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe meaning of form as the organization of intelligible musical ideas, logically\narticulated, is particularly evident in the music cited here. It is also evident (as stated\nin the first chapter) that the more developed forms cannot be constructed by laying\nmusical bricks together, or pouring musical concrete into preconceived moulds.\n\nOnly the sensitive formal feeling of the artist can determine the evolution of a\nmotive into the fully elaborated masterpiece, stripped of excess, but fully realizing\nthe composer\u2019s vision.\n\nClearly this book lays only a foundation, drawing from the practice of composers\nbasic principles, processes and methods, which can be imaginatively applied far beyond\nits limits.\n\nThe continued, intimate and thorough study of musical literature is the best means\nof extending and clarifying these concepts.\n",
