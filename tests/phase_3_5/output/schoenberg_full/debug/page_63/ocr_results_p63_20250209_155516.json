Worse, the mental capacity of singers to deal with\n\na more modern kind of melodic line is utterly inadequate to the requirements. Perhaps\nat no time has the gap between creation and performance been more discouraging,\n\nthe difference between those who call themselves \u2018artists\u2019 and those others who have\n\nproved to be creators.\n\nThe melody is certainly a simpler formulation than the theme. Condensation does\nnot admit a too detailed elaboration; concentration of the content in a single line\n\nexcludes presentation of remote consequences. Nevertheless, this formulation permits\n\nmuch more than the expression of popular ideas and commonplace feelings in a super-\n\nficial manner. Aesthetically, as well as for sound reasons of economy, there is no\n\nnobler contrast than to speak lightly of a great grief.\n\nAus meinen grossen Schmerzen\n\nMach ich die kleinen Lieder... .\n\n(Heine, Buch der Lieder)\n\nSo heroes belittle their wounds and their achievements\u2014this is the modesty of\n\ngreat men.\n\nai\n\n=\n\n~*~ +s 2 = \u00a9 = &\n\nrreyrt\n\n",
