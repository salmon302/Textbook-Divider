The initial segment of the transition (m. 18-21) consists of little more\nthan a modulatory progression. A sequence-like repetition ends on I of the mediant\nregion, overlapping the beginning of the subordinate theme.\n\nOp. 31/2-1I. The initial segment of the transition consists of two phrases above a\npedal point on Bb (m. 18-21), In m. 22, the first phrase is repeated in such a variation\nthat its second measure can be understood as deriving rhythmically from the second\nphrase. From this variant a little episode evolves, over a pedal point on V of the\ndominant region, which is liquidated in m. 27-30.\n\nFor additional examples of independent transitions, see also: Op. 10/1-I, m. 32;\nOp. 22-11, m. 13-18; Op. 90-I, m. 25.\n\nTRANSITIONS EVOLVING FROM THE PREVIOUS THEME\n\nTechnically, it makes no essential difference whether the process of modulation\nand liquidation is applied to a special theme, or to elements of the main theme. Some-\ntimes the modulation starts promptly and the transitional character is pronounced.\nIn other cases almost the entire main theme is repeated and transitional features are\npostponed to the last measures. These instances make the impression of varied repeti-\ntions, the transitional techniques at the end growing out of the variation.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/1-I. A transposition of the beginning of the main theme (m. 9) initiates the\nmodulation. Liquidation begins immediately, while the harmony moves sequentially\nto V of the mediant region (relative major), which, at the third approach, becomes\na pedal point below the subordinate theme.\n\nOp. 2/3-IV. A direct quotation of the first four measures of the main theme is\ndiverted harmonically by the introduction of D\u00a5 in its final chord. The last two mea-\nsures are sequenced and then liquidated by the chain-like linkage of residues in a\ndescending scale line, leading to V of the dominant region.\n\nOp. 14/!-I. A quotation of the beginning (m. 13) is diverted through chromatic\nprogressions to V of the dominant (m. 17), which is firmly established over a pedal\npoint.\n\nThe previous three examples grew out of the beginning of the main theme. The next\ntwo make use of its ending.\n\nOp. 13-1. After an introduction, the principal theme appears in m. 11. It ends on\nthe dominant in m. 35, with a quarter-note figure related to the initial figure. This\nfigure\u2014the \u2018tail\u2019 of the theme\u2014is picked up and used quasi-sequentially (m. 39) to\nlead to V of the relative major. (Oddly, the subordinate theme lies in eb, instead of the\nexpected Eb.)\n\n\"7 - * \u00a5 PEP \u00a5PPrerre\n\nTHE PARTS OF LARGER FORMS 181\n\nOp. 31/I-TII. In each of its many repetitions the main theme ends with a twice\nrepeated figure (cf. m. 15-16, 31-32). This figure (m. 33) supplies all the material for\nthe transition. Observe the reduction to its upbeat (m. 36), which, in chain linkage,\nprovides the liquidation.\n\nOp. 7-I. Here the opening motive is joined (m. 25-28) with a rhythmically new\nmotive-form (m. 27) to move rather abruptly to V of the dominant region (m. 35).\n\nIn some instances, instead of fragments of the main theme reorganized to produce\na distant formulation, the principal theme is repeated substantially in its entirety, but\nadapted to modulatory harmony.\n\nOp. 53-I. A slightly varied repetition of the beginning appears in m. 14. The con-\ntinuation in m. 18 is transposed up a third, as compared to the original statement in\nm. 5. An inserted measure (22) on the augmented sixth chord leads to V of E. The\nensuing passage work is considerably extended by way of liquidation. Thus every\nelement of the main theme appears in the transitional section.\n\nOp. 57-I. In m, 17 varied repetition of the beginning occurs. The long notes of the\noriginal formulation are subdivided into an alternating chord pattern, the insertion\nof which stretches the content of the first four measures to six. A varied repetition of\nthe last phrase (m. 23) is diverted to the dominant of ap minor. The ensuing measures\nof liquidation permit the ear to accept it as the dominant of Ab major at the entry\nof the subordinate theme (m. 36).\n\nThe modification, reduction or omission of the transition in the recapitulation\nsection are discussed on pp. 193-5.\n\nTHE RETRANSITION\n\nIn rondos, the return from the subordinate theme to the principal theme, and in\nsonatas, the return to the beginning after the exposition, are generally so simple that\nno special segment is necessary. Nevertheless, there are occasionally small connecting\nsegments, which act as both \u2018bridges\u2019 and \u2018spacers\u2019. See, for example, Op. 2/2-IV,\nm. 39-41, or m. 95-100; Op. 7-I1V, m. 48-49, and m. 89-93.\n\nFunctionally and psychologically more important are the retransitions after modu-\nlatory contrasts and Durchftihrungen. Since the actual remodulation usually takes place\nas a part of the preceding modulatory section, the retransition proper starts on the\nupbeat harmony, and generally consists of little more than liquidation of the motival\nresidues. The motive material often derives from subsidiary themes; sometimes refer-\nences to features of the principal theme forecast its return.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/2-I, m. 210-24, and Op. 10/I-I, m. 158-67, exhibit little more than\nliquidating devices around the dominant harmony.\nIn Op. 28-I, m. 257-68 the retransition carries out a real modulation, using motive\n\nee ee eH Hee eee et ee\n",
