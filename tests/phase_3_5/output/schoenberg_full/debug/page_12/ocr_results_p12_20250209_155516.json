Simplified practice forms,\nwhich do not always correspond to art forms, help a student to acquire the sense of\nform and a knowledge of the essentials of construction. It will be useful to start by\nbuilding musical blocks and connecting them intelligently.\n\nThese musical blocks (phrases, motives, etc.) will provide the material for building\nlarger units of various kinds, according to the requirements of the structure. Thus the\ndemands of logic, coherence and comprehensibility can be fuifilled, in relation to the\nneed for contrast, variety and fluency of presentation,\n\nII\n\nTHE PHRASE\n\nTHE smallest structural unit is the phrase, a kind of musical molecule consisting of a\nnumber of integrated musical events, possessing a certain completeness, and well\nadapted to combination with other similar units.\n\nThe term phrase means, structurally, a unit approximating to what one could sing\nin a single breath (Ex. 1).! Its ending suggests a form of punctuation such as a comma.\nOften some features appear more than once within the phrase. Such \u2018motivic\u2019\ncharacteristics will be discussed in the following chapter.\n\nIn homophonic-harmonic music, the essential content is concentrated in one voice,\nthe principal voice, which implies an inherent harmony. The mutual accommodation\nof melody and harmony is difficult at first. But the composer should never invent a\nmelody without being conscious of its harmony.\n\nWhen the melodic idea consists entirely or largely of notes outlining a single har-\nmony, or a simple succession of harmonies, there is little difficulty in determining and\nexpressing the harmonic implications. With such a clear harmonic skeleton, even\nrather elaborate melodic ideas can be readily related to their inherent harmony.\nExs. 2 and 3 illustrate such cases at several levels. Almost any simple harmonic pro-\ngression can be used, but for opening phrases I and V are especially useful, since they\nexpress the key most clearly.\n\nThe addition of non-chordal notes contributes to the fluency and interest of the\nphrase, provided they do not obscure or contradict the harmony. The various \u2018con-\nventional formulas\u2019 for using non-chordal notes (passing notes, auxiliary notes,\nchanging notes, suspensions, appoggiaturas, etc.) provide for harmonic clarity\nthrough the resolution of non-chordal into chordal notes.\n\nRhythm is particularly important in moulding the phrase. It contributes to interest\nand variety; it establishes character ; and it is often the determining factor in establish-\ning the unity of the phrase. The end of the phrase is usually differentiated rhythmically\nto provide punctuation.\n\nPhrase endings may be marked by a combination of distinguishing features, such\nas rhythmic reduction, melodic relaxation through a drop in pitch, the use of smaller\nintervals and fewer notes; or by any other suitable differentiation.\n\nThe length of a phrase may vary within wide limits (Ex. 4). Metre and tempo have\na great deal to do with phrase-length. In compound metres a length of two measures\n\n1 Exs. 1-11 at end of chapter, pp. 5-7.\n",
