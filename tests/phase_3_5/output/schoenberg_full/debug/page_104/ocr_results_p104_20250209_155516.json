The two-\nmeasure phrase (m. 17-18), a rhythmicized chromatic scale, is followed by a descend-\ning variation which is distinguished by deviations and deflections. A second repetition\nof the original phrase leads directly to the upbeat harmony.\n\nOp. 13-IIL. A four-measure phrase (m. 25-28) is followed by a varied repetition\n(m. 29-33). A triplet figure in m. 33 leads to a cadence in m. 37. An imitative episode\non the same figure is liquidated and again brought to a cadence in m. 43. Another\nsharply contrasted segment (m. 44) with a varied repetition gives way to a recur-\nrence (m. 51) of the triplet figure, which in turn gives way to a remodulation.\n\nOp. 14/1-III. The entire subordinate theme comprises eight measures (m. 22-29),\na four-measure segment and its repetition.\n\nIt is evident that great diversity as to length and complexity may occur, even within\nthe style of a single composer. The evidence suggests, if generalization can be made,\na \u2018looser\u2019 construction, depending on immediate repetition of relatively short seg-\nments, joined to others by mere juxtaposition; and a lesser degree of internal develop-\nment.\n\nTHE \u2018LYRIC THEME\u2019\n\nUnder the influence of Schubert, theorists began to call the subordinate theme\nGesangsthema, or \u2018lyric theme\u2019. This was a mistake, for there exist many subordinate\nthemes which are not lyric at all. But this nomenclature had a curious influence on\nthe minds of composers, suggesting the creation of longer and longer lyric melodies.\nThe lyric, or singable, character is the result of a loose construction intimately related\nto that of popular music. The \u2018looseness\u2019 consists in disregarding almost all features\nexcept the rhythmic ones, thus neglecting the profounder implications, and providing\nrichness of content through the multiplication of themes.\n\nOf course, lyric subordinate themes appear in the works of predecessors of Schubert,\nbecause they form one of the potential contrasts. See, for instance, Mozart, Symphony\nin g, K.V. 550-I, m. 44; String Quartet in F, K.V. 590-1, m. 31; Beethoven, Piano\nSonatas, Op. 10/1-I, m. 56; Op. 13-I, m. 51 ff.; Op. 31/1-I, m. 66 ff.; Op. \u00a73-I, m.\n35; Op. 57-I, m. 36; String Quartet, Op. 18/4-I, m. 34.\n\nTypical examples from Schubert include: Piano Sonata, Op. 143-I, m. 60 ff.;\nSonata in c, op. posth.-I, m. 40; String Quartet in d-I, m. 61; String Quartet, Op. 163-\nI, m. 60 and IV, m. 46; Piano Trio in Bb, Op. 99-1; Piano Trio in Ep, Op. 100-1.\n\nTypical examples from Brahms: String Quartet, Op. 51/2-f, m. 46; String Quintet,\nOp. 111-1, m. 26; Second Symphony-TI, at \u2018C\u2019; Third Symphony-I, fourteen measures\nafter \u2018B\u2019.\n\nAmong these examples the popular touch can readily be observed. Unified by a\npersistent rhythm, the intervals change freely. In Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony-I, m.\n\nTHE PARTS OF LARGER FORMS 185\n\n63-93, there is continuous movement in quarter-notes which persists for thirty-one\nmeasures. The first phrase (four measures) is repeated twice without structural change,\nand followed by two more four-measure phrases plus liquidation. The simple con-\nstruction is self-evident.\n\nThe piano does not lend itself readily to the song-like. Accordingly the lyric quality\nis not so obvious in a piano theme as, for instance, in a theme for strings. In the pre-\nviously mentioned illustrations from the Beethoven sonatas, one finds that the con-\ntrast is produced by multiple repetition, unvaried or slightly varied, of relatively long\nphrases. In Op. 13-I, an eight-measure theme (m. 51) appears three times. Op. 31/I-I\npresents a four-measure phrase (in mediant major, m. 66) in which a syncopated\nrhythm appears three times. This phrase is repeated twice with slight variations, the\nsecond time in mediant minor.\n\nIn Op. 53-I, the lyric character (\u2018dolce e molto legato\u2019, m. 35) is clear in spite of the\npiano style. Substantially the same rhythmic pattern appears seven times. In Op. 57-I,\nm. 36 ff., within each of the three rhythmically identical appearances of the two-\nmeasure phrase, the rhythmic motive itself appears three times. The lyric character\nof this theme becomes particularly evident if one compares it with the \u2018agitato\u2019 section\nfollowing (m. 51 ff.).\n\nTHE CODA\n\nSince many movements have no codas, it is evident that the coda must be con-\nsidered as an extrinsic addition. The assumption that it serves to establish the tonality\nis hardly justified; it could scarcely compensate for failure to establish the tonality\nin the previous sections. In fact, it would be difficult to give any other reason for the\naddition of a coda than that the composer wants to say something more.\n\nThis may also account for the observed diversity of size and shape. In Op. 2/1-I\nthere is only a short extension, hardly worth calling a coda. A short coda of 12\nmeasures ends the first movement of Beethoven\u2019s String Quartet, Op. 18/6. In Op.\n2/2-IV, the coda (m. 148-87) is 40 measures long; in Op. 2/3-I (m. 218-57) it is also\n40 measures; in Op, 2/3-IV (m. 259-312) it is 54 measures. But in the first movement\nof the Eroica Symphony, the coda is 135 measures long\u2014almost a fifth of the entire\nmovement.\n\nWhile an inclusive generalization is impossible, many codas conform more or less\nto the following description.\n\nUsually they start with richly elaborated cadences, containing deviations leading\neven into rather remote regions. As the length of the segments decreases, so also the\ncomplexity of the cadences decreases. The last codettas may omit even the cadential\nsubdominant. Interchange of V and I often gives way to mere repetitions of the\ntonic. The motive material is, for the most part, derived from previous themes,\nreformulated to conform to cadential harmony and effectively liquidated. Many\n",
