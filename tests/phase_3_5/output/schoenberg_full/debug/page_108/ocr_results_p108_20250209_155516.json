This movement is extremely long, even\nthough the basic structure is simple, because of the many repetitions of the main\ntheme. The full theme, including its internal repetitions, appears at the beginning no\nless than four times. The B-section appears both times in tonic major. In the recapitula-\ntion (m. 150) the theme appears complete only once. A fugato elaboration (m. 183) on\nthe main motive replaces the repetitions.\n\nOTHER SIMPLE RONDOS\n\nThe patterns ABABA and ABACA are rather infrequently used as independent forms\n(though they appear by analogy in the minuet with conventional repetitions\u2014||: a:||: B\nA: ||, which is, in fact, A-A-B-A\u2014B\u2014A\u2014and in scherzos with more than one trio).\n\nOp. 2/3-I1. (ABABA.) In consequence of the numerous appearances of slightly varied\nforms of the basi\u00a2 motive, the leading theme consists of only ten measures, But the\nB-section is surprisingly long\u2014thirty-two measures. It is a striking instance of \u2018loose\nformulation\u2019. Although there are three distinct motive-forms, each repeated a number\nof times, the treatment is very irregular. The phrases differ in length; the motive-forms\nchange in interval and direction; some parts start like sequences, but are not, etc.\nThe syncopated figure in m. 19, although each half-measure is melodious, does not\nreveal any real continuity if played alone. Its meaning is scarcely more than embellish-\nment of tones of the harmony, an \u00e9tude-like procedure which is characteristic of\nloosely formulated contrasting sections. In effect, the harmony ts the melody.\n\nThe recapitulation of B (m. 55), transposed as usual to the tonic, is reduced to only\ntwelve measures, omitting entirely the sixteenth-note figure of m. 13, 16 and 17. The\nsyncopated figure is repeated in a very free manner, indicating that the special melodic\ncontour of the previous statement was non-obligatory. The leading theme recurs for\nthe third time in m. 67, varied only slightly, and a short codetta follows.\n\nOp. 13-II. (aBaca.) The leading theme consists of eight measures, repeated, with\nminor changes in the accompaniment, an octave higher. The subordinate theme (m.\n17) is rudimentary, consisting of little more than a motive-form stated and liquidated\nwhile the harmony moves from the submediant region to the dominant. In m. 29\nA returns without change, and the repetition is omitted. The second subordinate\ntheme resembles the first in character and treatment, but is carried out more elabo-\nrately, going into the flat submediant region by enharmonic change (\u00a3 \u2014 Fb). The\nfinal recapitulation of a, complete with repetition, presents only a minor rhythmic\nvariation in the accompaniment. The usual codettas follow.\n\nRavel, Pavane pour une Infante D\u00e9funte. (ABACA.) The main structure is self-evident.\nEach of the subordinate themes is immediately repeated with slight variations. The\nirregular dimensions of the sections (B is 64 measures; c is 94) enhance the interest of\nan otherwise exceedingly simple construction.\n\n-vwezePrpevrerwevw?#e\n\nLd\n\nTHE RONDO FORMS 193\n\nVARIATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE RECAPITULATION (PRINCIPAL THEME)\n\nFrom a structural standpoint, changes in the principal theme when it recurs are not\nnecessary. But variation for its own sake is one of the distinguishing features of\nhigher art. In the larger forms an unchanged repetition seldom occurs.\n\nThe melodic outline and the thematic structure are usually preserved. The simplest\ntype of variation is a change of sonority brought about by a different setting, as in\nOp. 13-II, m. 9-16. In Beethoven\u2019s String Quartet, Op. 18/6-II, there are six different\nsettings of the basic segment (m. 1-4), including transposition, figuration, omamental\nadditions and addition of semi-contrapuntal voices.\n\nIn piano style such freedom of voice-treatment is not always possible. Accordingly,\nembellishments in the melody, changes of octave, subdivision of the accompaniment\nand enrichment of the figuration are the usual variants.\n\nIllustrations from the literature\n\nOp. 2/2-IV. Variations of the upbeat can be observed in m. 41, 53, 100, 104, 112\nand 135. Embellishments of the melody occur in m. 43, 102, 108, 137 and elsewhere.\n\nOp. 7-IV. The fourth appearance of the main theme (m. 143), an octave higher than\nthe original, is varied in m. 147 by the use of unifying syncopations and inserted\nchromatic tones. The omission, in the first repetition of the ternary main theme (m.\n51), of the A\u2019-section is unusual. The unexpected Bh at the end of the s-section leads\nprematurely to the trio. A similar surprise appearance of the By in m. 155 produces\nan abrupt modulation to the Neapolitan region, introducing the coda. Was the first\nBy introduced as a preparation for the second, or did the second merely take advan-\ntage of the accidental appearance of the first? Which came first, the hen or the egg?\n\nOp. 7-II. The beginning of the recapitulation is unchanged. In the continuation\n(m. 60) there are minor variations of the ornamental connectives, and interpolated\nfigures (m. 65 ff.).\n\nOp. 10/3-IV. The theme is varied by interpolation of imitations (m. 57 ff.) and\nfigurations (m. 85 ff.).\n\nOp. 22-IV. The third appearance of the theme presents a quasi-contrapuntal inter-\nchange of voices (m. 112), though the right hand is not elaborated. However, the\noctave figure suggests the octave tremolando in the continuation (m. 122). In the last\nrepetition (m. 165) the melodic line is elaborated with triplets, against the duple\naccompaniment. Other changes are confined to ornamental variations in the ap-\nproaches to cadences.\n\nOp. 28-IV. The repetitions are varied merely through the addition of mellifluous\nphrases in the fifth and sixth measures.\n\nOp. 31/2-II. The repetition (m. 43) seems at first glance to be more remotely varied\nthan in the previous cases. However, beyond the interpolation of additional statements\n",
