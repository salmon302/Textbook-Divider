Their construction, accor-\ndingly, may be asymmetrical or irregular. The uneven number of measures may be\ncaused by the length of basic units (motives or phrases), the number of such units,\nor the combination of units of differing lengths.\n\nThere are asymmetrical periods which are divided in unequal parts, for instance\n4+6 (Exs. 45a, 47a, 59b, c, 4). There are also symmetrical periods whose smaller\nsegments are not divisible by four, e.g. 3-+-3 (Ex. Sle); 5+5 (Ex. 44a; 114); or 646\n(Ex. 102c). Ex. 46\u00a2 (5-+ 7) is an asymmetrical period made up of uneven segments, but\nlike all the preceding illustrations comprises an even number of measures.\n\nSentences are more frequently composed of elements of differing Iengths than\nperiods, even if the total number of measures is even. Ex. 57 is 4+5; Ex. 6lc is also\n4(2+2) +5 (1+141+4+2). Ex. 61d is 5+4. Ex. 59/ is made up of five units totalling\nseven measures (1 +2+1-+1 4-2).\n\nIn many cases the construction is complicated by the inclusion of internal repeti-\ntions, sequential or varied (Exs. 57, 59d. 4, 604, 61c); by stretching as in Exs. 44/ and\n47a, where a cadence that normally would occupy two measures is extended to three;\nor by additions after the cadence (Exs. 59c, 60a). In Ex. 59a, from the standpoint of\nmelodic construction, there could be a cadence ending in m. 8, or, following the caden-\ntial harmonies of m. 9, a close in m. 10 or 1{. But all these earlier opportunities are\ningeniously evaded, thus extending the sentence to thirteen measures, Ex. 60/ is\nconstructed by internal repetitions of elements of differing lengths: 3(2 + 1)+3(2+1)\n}4(2+2)4-2-4-2.\n\nThe extraordinary Brahms example, Ex. Sle, is a period of six measures. The ante-\ncedent and consequent (three measures long) each combine one 3/4 and two 2/4\nmeasures. Nevertheless it is symmetrical and regular.\n\nThere exist forms which are built exclusively from phrases of an uneven length.\nFor instance, the opening theme of the last movement of Brahms's Piano Quartet in\ng-minor is an A-B--A! form and consists of ten three-measure phrases. A phrase like\nthese, consisting of six quarter-notes, may be understood as resembling one measure\nof 3/2, which demonstrates its naturalness (Ex. 1085). The same explanation applies\n\n",
