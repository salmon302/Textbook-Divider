When used in connexion with binary,\nternary or rondo form, it refers chiefly to the number of parts.! The phrase sonata form\nsuggests, instead, the size of the parts and the complexity of their interrelationships.\nIn speaking of minuet, scherzo and other dance forms, one has in mind the metre,\ntempo and rhythmic characteristics which identify the dance.\n\nUsed in the aesthetic sense, form means that a piece is organized; i.e. that it consists\nof clements functioning like those of a living organism.\n\nWithout organization music would be an amorphous mass, as unintelligible as an\nessay without punctuation, or as disconnected as a conversation which leaps purpose-\nlessly from one subject to another.\n\nThe chief requirements for the creation of a comprehensible form are logic and\ncoherence.

Thus appro-\npriate subdivision facilitates understanding and determines the form.\n\nThe size and number of parts does not always depend on the size of a piece.\nGenerally, the larger the piece, the greater the number of parts. But sometimes a short\npiece may have the same number of parts as a longer one, just as a midget has the\nsame number of limbs, the same form, as a giant.\n\nA composer does not, of course, add bit by bit, as a child does in building with\nwooden blocks. He conceives an entire composition as a spontaneous vision. Then he\n\n1 \u2018Part\u2019 is used in the most general sense to indicate undifferentiated elements, sections or subdivisions\nof a piece. Other terms will be used later to distinguish parts of various sizes and with different functions.\n\n",
