Op. 14/2-I] and Op. 26-1\nare ternary. An exceptional case is the passacaglia-like theme, a sentence of cight\nmeasures, of the 32 Variations inc.\n\nThe harmony should be simple, and should not change too frequently or too irregu-\nlarly. See, for example, Beethoven's 15 Variations in Eb, Op. 35; Diabelli Variations,\nOp. 120; 12 Variations in A; 24 Variations in D; 6 Variations in G; 6 Easy Variations\nin G, Except for the cadential segment, none of these themes contains more than two\nharmonies to a measure. In Op. 35 there is one harmony per measure; in the A Varia-\ntions there are two; and in the D and G Variations there are three harmonies to two\nmeasures. But in the first eight measures of the Diahelli Waltz, the harmony changes\nonly once. The use of mere interchange of I and V contributes to the simplicity of\nmany of these themes.\n\nThe harmony of the 6 Variations in G, though simple, is characteristic, especially\nbecause of the sequence in the middle section. The same procedure, among others,\ncontributes to the memorability of the theme of Op. 26-1.\n\nEven a master like Beethoven did not make many variations when the theme was\nlong or complicated as, for instance, in the 6 Variations in F, Op. 34; and perhaps also\nin Op. 14/2-II.\n\nA unifying accompaniment facilitates variation, while one which changes too much\n\ncan be a handicap. For this reason Beethoven, in the 9 Variations on a March of\n\nDressler, makes no other change in the first variation than the substitution of a\nunifying accompaniment.\n\nIt is not easy to write a good original theme for variation. Jt may, therefore, be\nuseful to select a theme whose suitability has already been proved, in sets of variations\nby such masters as Haydn, Mozart and Becthoven.\n\nRELATION BETWEEN THEME AND VARIATIONS\n\nThe form originated, perhaps, in the custom of repeating a pleasant theme several\ntimes, avoiding a decline of interest by introducing embellishments and other addi-\ntions. This may be why the classic masters made it a point that the theme should be\nrecognizable in the variation.\n\nThus the course of events should not be changed, even if the character is changed ;\nthe number and order of the segments remains the same. Sometimes the metre ts\nchanged, the tempo is changed or the number of measures is systematically multiplied\n\n1 This type of theme structure is characterized by two balanced segments, built from closely related but\ndifferentiated motive-forms, so that the second section is in some respects a contrast. Generally the first\nsegment ends on the dominant; the second begins in the dominant (or other closely related) region, and\ncloses with a cadence to L.\n\nThe difference between this structure and the small ternary form may consist in the absence of a real\nmotival contrast (72 Variations in A); or in the absence of an identifiable repetition (24 Variations in D).\n\n\"yf + \u00a9 Pe YP, FET\n\nTHEME AND VARIATIONS 169\n\nby two or three. But, in general, the proportions and structural relations of the parts,\nand the main features, are preserved. Of course, the viewpoint as to which constitute\nthe main features is subject to change. Every variation should possess the same quality\nof formal self-sufficiency and coherence as the theme itself.\n\nTHE MOTIVE OF VARIATION\n\nIn classical music every variation shows a unity which surpasses that of the theme.\nIt results from the systematic application of a motive of variation. In higher forms\nthe motive derives from the theme itself, thus connecting all the variations intimately\nwith the theme.\n\nIn the practice form the motive should consist of a predetermined figure, modified\nno more than accommodation to the harmony and structure requires (see, for example,\nthe first eleven of the Variations in \u00a2 minor),\n\nPRODUCTION OF THE MOTIVE OF VARIATION\n\nIn order to arrive at a suitable motive of variation, it is necessary to recognize the\nessentials of the theme. Simplification by omission of everything which can be con-\nsidered subordinate (e.g. embellishments, grace notes, passing notes, suspensions,\nappoggiaturas, trills, runs, etc.) unveils the basic construction, In making this reduc-\ntion the relation to the harmony must be taken into consideration (see Exs. 124a,\n126a). The simultaneous rhythmic simplification sometimes requires regularization,\nas in the last four measures of Ex. 124a, where some features have to be shifted to\nother beats. Since the viewpoint determining what features are essential is not neces-\nsarily uniform for all variations, there may be more than one usable \u2018skeleton\u2019.\n\nSince the motive of variation must be adaptable to the chosen \u2018skeleton\u2019, its nature\nand length will be limited by the number and distribution of the principal tones and\nharmonies. It will scarcely be longer than two measures; in many cases it is a half-\nmeasure or even less,\n\nVariation around the principal tones. In the motives for at least the first few\nvariations, it is common practice to circumscribe the principal tones with neighbour-\ning tones. Often tones of the theme are included in parts of scale lines or broken\nchords. Of course, such elements must fit the expressed harmony. The rhythmic\norganization of the motive of variation has a great deal to do with its character. It is\nnormally maintained consistently throughout the variation.\n\nlilustrations from the literature\n\nBeethoven, Diabelli Variations. A considerable number of the variations (2, 9, II,\n12, 14, 18, 28, for example) derive the motive of variation from more or less elaborate\ncircumscription of the principal tones. Examples 1245, c and d show some of these\n\n",
