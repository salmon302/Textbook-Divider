1.7 
DEFINITION: A group is a semigroup with identity in which every element
has an, inverse.
The abstract definitions of "semigroup" and "group" (1.4.3; 1.7) are
consistent with the earlier use of those terms in connection with families of
transformations (1.3.2; 1.3.4).
1.8.1 
DEFINITION: Given a binary composition BIN on a family X, elements x
and y commute if BIN(y, x) = BIN(x, y), that is, if yx = xy in multiplicative
notation. The composition BIN is commutative if every pair of elements
commutes. A semigroup or group is commutative if its binary composition is
commutative.
The group of transposition and inversion operations on the twelve pitch-
classes is non-commutative. To illustrate this, let T2 be the operation of
