Mathematical Preliminaries

transposing-by-2; let I, J, and K be the respective operations of inverting-
about-C, inverting-about-B, and inverting-about-Cft. Then, as we observed
earlier, IT2 = J (1.2.5). On the other hand, T2I = K. Thus the operations T2
and I do not commute. (Remember that we are using left orthography.
"IT2 = J" means: "Given any sample pitch-class s, if you invert-about-C the
2-transpose of s, you will obtain the inversion-about-B of the given s."
"T2I = K" means: "Given any sample pitch-class s, if you transpose-by-2
the inversion-about-C of s, you will obtain the inversion-about-C# of the
given s.")

DEFINITION: Given a binary composition BIN on a family X, an
element c of X is central if c commutes with every x in X. The family of all
central c is the center of the system (X, BIN).
