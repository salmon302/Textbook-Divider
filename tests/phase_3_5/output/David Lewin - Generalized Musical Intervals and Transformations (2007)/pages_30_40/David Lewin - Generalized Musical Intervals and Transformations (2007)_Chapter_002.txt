Mathematical Preliminaries 
1.3.1
For an example, let us take S, S', and S" all to be the family of positive
integers. Let f^s) = s + 3, f{(s) = 2s, f2(s) = 2s, and f^s) = s + 6. The four
specified functions satisfy the functional equation f'1f1
 = f^. That is, given
any integer s, if we compute fjfi(s), multiplying by two the result of adding 3
to s, we obtain the same net result as we do when we compute f^Cs), adding 6
to the result of multiplying s by two.
For another example, let us take S, S', and S" all to be the family of the
twelve pitch-classes. Let f(s) = s transposed by 2, f(s) = s inverted with
respect to the pitch class C, and f"(s) = s inverted with respect to the pitch
class B. The three specified functions satisfy the functional equation f'f = f".
That is, given any pitch class s, if we compute f T(s), inverting about C the
result of transposing s by 2, we obtain the same net result as we do when we
compute f"(s), inverting the given s about B.
1.2.6.1 
DEFINITION: The function f from S into S' is onto S' if every member of
S' is the value of some argument. (Every member of S' appears at least once in
the right-hand column of the function table.)
1.2.6.2 
DEFINITION: The function f from S into S' is 1-to-l if no two distinct
arguments share the same value. (No member of S' appears more than once in
the right-hand column of the function table.)
1.2.6.3 DEFINITION: Let f be a 1-to-l function from S onto S'. Then f"1, the
inverse function off, is defined as the family of pairs (s', s) within S' x S such
that (s, s') is a member of f.
1.2.6.4 
THEOREMS: Given the situation as in 1.2.6.3 above, then f ~* is indeed
a function in the sense of 1.2.1. f-1 is in fact a 1-to-l function from S' onto S.
The inverse function off"1 is, of course, f.
The theorems are stated without proof.
1.2.6.5 
THEOREM: Let f and f' be functions from S into S' and from S' into S
respectively. Suppose that the functions satisfy the two conditions (A) and (B)
following. (A): for every s in S, f'f(s) = s. (B): for every s' in S', ff'(s') = s'.
Then f and f' are both 1 -to-1; they are respectively onto S' and onto S; and they
are inverse functions, each of the other.
The theorem is given without proof.
1.3.1 
DEFINITION: A function from a family S into S itself will be called a
transformation on S. If the function is 1-to-l and onto, it will be called an
operation on S.

1.3.2 
Mathematical Preliminaries
1.3.2 
DEFINITION: Given a family S, a collection F of transformations on S is
called closed if, given any members f and g of F, the composition fg is a
member of F. A closed collection of transformations on S will also be called a
semigroup of transformations on S.
1.3.3.1 
DEFINITION: The identity operation on a family S is that operation 1
on S which assigns the value 1 (s) = s to any argument s.
1.3.3.2 
THEOREM: For any transformation f on S, the functional equations
If = f and fl = fare true (in the sense of 1.2.5 above).
1.3.3.3 
THEOREM: A transformation f on S is an operation (i.e., 1-to-l and
onto) if and only if there exists a transformation f on S satisfying the
functional equations f T = 1; ff' = 1. If this be the case then f' is the inverse
operation of f.
The theorem follows from the various matters studied over section 1.2.6.
1.3.4 
DEFINITION: By a group of operations on S we shall mean a family (i.e.
collection) G of transformations on S which satisfies conditions (A) and (B)
following. (A): G is a closed family, a semigroup of transformations in the
sense of 1.3.2. (B): Given any member f of G, there exists a member f of G
satisfying f'f = ff = 1.
Condition (B) guarantees that the members of G are indeed operations,
via 1.3.3.3. (B) also guarantees that G contains the inverse operation for each
of its member operations. (A) and (B) together imply that G contains the
identity operation 1, provided that G contains any members. Whether we call
G a "collection" or a "family" is immaterial; for us the terms are synonymous
with each other as they also are with the terms "ensemble" and "set-in-the-
mathematical-sense."
