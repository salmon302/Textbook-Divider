Chapter 10 applies the network concept in a variety of ways to passages

Note on Musical Terminology
All references to specific pitches in this book will be made according to the
notation suggested by the Acoustical Society of America: The pitch class is
symbolized by an upper-case letter and its specific octave placement by a
number following the letter. An octave number refers to pitches from a given
C through the B a major seventh above it. Cello C is C2, viola C is C3, middle
C is C4, and so on. Any B# gets the same octave number as the B just below it;
thus B#3 is enharmonically C4. Likewise, any Cb gets the same octave number
as the C just above it; thus Q?4 is enharmonically B3.
