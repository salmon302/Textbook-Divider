# Graph Test Data

This directory contains test images for the graph extraction module, including:

1. Simple test graphs generated programmatically
2. Sample graphs from Lewin's "Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations"
3. Complex mathematical notation and transformational theory diagrams

The test images are used to verify the graph extraction functionality, including:
- Node detection (pitch classes, intervals)
- Edge detection (arrows, lines)
- Mathematical label extraction
- Complex graph structure analysis
