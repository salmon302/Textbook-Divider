THE MOTIVE 3 WHAT CONSTITUTES A MOTIVE Any rhythmicized succession of notes can be used asa basic motive, but there should not be too many different features.
Rhythmic features may be very simple, even for the main theme of a sonata (Ex. 12a) .
A symphony can be built on scarcely more complex rhythmic features (Exs. 125, c, 13) .
The examples from Beethoven's Fifth symphony consist primarily of note - repetitions, which sometimes contribute distinctive characteristics.
A motive need not contain o great many interval features.
The main theme of Brahms’s Fourth symphony (Ex. 13) , though also containing sixths and octaves, iS, as the analysis shows, constructed on a succession of thirds.
Often a contour or shape is significant, although the rhythmic treatment and inter- vals change.
The upward leap in Ex. 12a, the movement up by step in Ex. 16; the upward sweep followed by a retum within it which pervades Op. 2/ illustrate such cases.
Every element or feature of a motive or phrase must be considered to be a motive if it is treated as such, i e. if it is repeated with or without variation.
THE MOTIVE Even the writing of simple phrases involves the invention and use of motives, though perhaps unconsciously.
Consciously used, the motive should produce unity, relation- ship, coherence, logic, comprehensibility and fluency.
The motive generally appears in a characteristic and impressive manner at the beginning of a piece.
The features of a motive are intervals and rhythms, combined to produce a memorable shape or contour which usually implies an inherent harmony.
Inasmuch as almost every figure within a piece reveals some relationship to it, the basic motive is often considered the ‘germ’ of the idea.
Since it includes elements, at least, of every subsequent musical figure, one could consider it the ‘smallest common And since it ig included in every subsequent figure, it could be considered the ‘greatest common factor’.
However, everything depends on its use.
Whether motive be simple or complex, whether it consists of few or many features, the final impression of the piece is not determined by its primary form.
Everything depends on its treatment and develop- ment.
A appears constantly throughout piece: if is repeated.
Repetition alone often gives rise to monotony.
Monotony can only be overcome by variation.
TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF THE MOTIVE A motive is used by repetition.
The repetition may be exact, modified or developed.
Exact repetitions preserve all features and relationships.
Transpositions to a different degree, inversions, retrogrades, diminutions and augmentations are exact repetitions if they preserve strictly the features and note relations (Ex. 14) .
Modified repetitions are created through variation.
They provide variety and produce new material (motive-forms) for subsequent use.
Some variations, however, are merely local and have little or no influence on the continuation.
Variation, it must be remembered, is repetition in which some features are changed and the rest preserved.
All the features of rhythm , interval, harmony and contour are subject to various alterations.
Frequently, several methods of variation are applied to several features simultaneously; but such changes must not produce a motive-form too foreign to the basic motive.
In the course of a piece, a motive-form may be developed further through subsequent variation.
Exs. 15 and 16 are illustrations.
Use of the motive requires variation Variation means change.
But changing every feature produces something foreign, incoherent, illogical.
It destroys the basic shape of the motive.
Accordingly, variation requires changing some of the features and preserving some of the more-important ones.
Preservation of rhythmic features effectively produces coherence (though monotony cannot be avoided without slight changes) .
For the rest, determining which features are more important depends on the compositional objective.
Through substantial variety of motive-forms, adapted to every formal function, can be produced.
Homophonic music can be called the style of ‘developing variation’.
This means that COMMENT ON EXAMPLES in the succession of motive-forms produced through variation of the basic motive,
In Exs. 17-29, based solely on a broken chord , some of the methods which can be there is something which can be compared to development, to growth.
But changes applied are shown as systematically as is practicable. of subordinate meaning, which have no special consequences, have only the local References to the literature identified only by opus apply to Beethoven piano sonatas.

Such changes are better termed variants. ate of their general aceessibility, a great many Fe erences 1o them appear in the later chapters.
