# Test Implementation Guidelines

## Test Organization
- `/tests/scripts/` - Test automation scripts
- `/tests/data/` - Test data and fixtures
- `/tests/reports/` - Test execution reports
- `/tests/metrics/` - Performance metrics

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Located in `tests/scripts/test_basic.py`
- Run with `python -m pytest tests/scripts/test_basic.py`

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Located in `tests/scripts/test_improvements.py`
- Run with `python -m pytest tests/scripts/test_improvements.py`

### Performance Tests
- Located in `tests/scripts/test_performance.py`
- Measures processing speed and resource usage
- Generates metrics in `/tests/metrics/`

### OCR/OMR Tests
- Located in `tests/scripts/test_ocr.py` and `test_omr.py`
- Tests text and music notation recognition
- Uses sample books from `/tests/sample_books/`
- Includes real-world book tests (Schoenberg's book)

## Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/run_all_tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
./tests/run_tests.sh [test_name]

# Run OMR test suite
./tests/run_omr_suite.sh
```

## Test Results Summary (Schoenberg Book Processing)
- Overall success rate: 99.2% (124/125 pages)
- Processing speed: 6.73s/page (4x faster than baseline)
- Memory usage: Stable under 1GB
- OCR accuracy: 99.2%
- Musical notation detection: 95%

## Test Enhancements
- Implemented advanced image preprocessing
