# Test Plan for Textbook Divider

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Textbook Divider project, updated with findings from processing Schoenberg's Fundamentals of Musical Composition.

## Test Categories

### 1. Chapter Detection Tests
- Standard chapter formats (Chapter 1, Chapter One, etc.)
- Roman numeral chapters (I, II, III)
- Custom chapter formats (Unit 1, Section 1, etc.)
- Nested chapters (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- Complex cases (subtitles, multi-line titles)
- Musical notation sections

### 2. OCR Quality Tests
- Resolution variations (>300 DPI, <150 DPI)
- Text complexity (columns, footnotes, equations)
- Format handling (PDF, EPUB)
- Mixed content (text + musical notation)
- Performance metrics
- Error recovery testing

### 3. Musical Notation Tests
- Staff detection accuracy
- Symbol recognition
- Mixed content handling
- Complex notation patterns
- Multi-staff layouts

### 4. Integration Tests
- End-to-end workflows
- Cross-component interaction
- Resource handling
- External services
- Cache system performance
- Memory management

### 5. Transformation Network Tests
- Graph structure detection
- Mathematical symbol recognition
- Isomorphism detection
- Layout analysis (circular, linear, complex)
- Edge relationship mapping
- Multi-scale template matching
- Confidence scoring validation
