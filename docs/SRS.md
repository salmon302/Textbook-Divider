# Software Requirements Specification
## Textbook Divider

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Purpose
The Textbook Divider is a software tool designed to process various text-based book formats (TXT, PDF, EPUB) and convert them into organized, chapter-separated text files while improving formatting and readability.

#### 1.2 Scope
The system will handle the input of various book formats, process them to identify chapter boundaries, clean up formatting issues, and output individual chapter files in a clean, consistent format.

### 2. Functional Requirements

	- Plain text (.txt)
	- PDF documents (.pdf)
	- EPUB files (.epub)
- File validation and error handling for unsupported formats
- Progress indication during file processing

#### 2.2 Chapter Detection
- Identify chapter boundaries using:
	- Common chapter indicators (Chapter X, CHAPTER X, etc.)
	- Numerical chapter headings
	- Roman numeral chapter headings
	- Custom chapter heading patterns
- Support for various chapter naming conventions
- Handle books with non-standard chapter markings

#### 2.3 Text Processing
- Remove excess line breaks and whitespace
- Normalize paragraph formatting
- Preserve important formatting elements
- Handle special characters and encoding issues
- Repair common OCR artifacts
- Maintain proper sentence and paragraph structure

#### 2.4 Output Generation
- Create individual text files for each chapter
- Consistent naming convention for output files
- Organized output directory structure
- Maintain proper text encoding (UTF-8)
